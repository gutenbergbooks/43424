<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you take a steamer in New York whose
destination is the eastern coast of South America,
and remain on it a little over four weeks, you
will reach the great metropolis of our twin
continent, Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>In all probability they will be weeks of infinite
content and delight, for the southern half
of the Atlantic Ocean is milder in her moods than
the northern half, and there will be a sufficient
number of stops <i>en route</i> to relieve the journey
of monotony.</p>

<p>First comes the Barbadoes, then Pernambuco,
Bahia, Rio-de-Janeiro, and Santos in Brazil,
and then Montevideo, the capital of the Republic
of Uruguay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>At Montevideo the steamer leaves the ocean
and enters the mouth of the River Plata, which
is several hundred miles wide at this point,
and in ten hours the beautiful city of Buenos
Aires, the gate-way to the Pampas, is spread
out before the eye.</p>

<p>It is more like a city of North America than
any of the South American metropolises, both
in its appearance and its remarkable spirit of
modernization.</p>

<p>Beyond, and about this attractive port, lie
great tracts of level country known as the
<i>campo</i>, and here you will find conditions not
unlike those existing in some parts of our own
western territory. Large ranches predominate,
although the industries are varied.</p>

<p>The people are of mixed nationalities, but the
greater proportion is of Spanish extraction and a
new race, or type, is being welded with a sufficient
infusion of Anglo-Saxon blood to counteract
the inherent tendency of all Latin races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
towards procrastination. Because of this, and
aided by an unequalled climate, a fertile soil,
and definite aims, they are already achieving
a part of their manifest destiny.</p>

<p>This, the year of 1910, the publication date
of this small volume, marks the one hundredth
anniversary of Argentina's independence; may
it mark also the beginning of an era of even
greater harmony and more splendid achievement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANCISCO'S HOME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Francisco</span> sat crosslegged in one corner of
the <i>patio</i> under the shade of a small pomegranate
tree which grew in a tub. He had moved
halfway around the <i>patio</i> since morning, trying
to keep out of the sun. Just after <i>caf√©</i> he had
started out under the shade of the east wall,
where wistaria vines and jasmine grew in a
dense mass of purple, yellow and green; then
he had gone from one tubbed shelter to another
as the sun mounted higher, until now only the
heavy foliage of the pomegranate offered protection
from the hot rays. All of the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
varnished blinds at the doors of the rooms
opening upon this central, stone-paved courtyard,
had long since been closed securely, for it
was middle December and the house must be
sealed early against the noon heat of midsummer.</p>

<p>Francisco might have gone inside, where the
darkened rooms furnished some relief, but he
chose to sit crosslegged on the red and white
square stones of the <i>patio</i>, with his back to
the main part of the house, so that the mother
and sisters could not see what occupied his
busy hands.</p>

<p>Francisco's father was dead, and he, with
his mother, La Se√±ora Anita Maria Lacevera
de Gonzalez, and his two sisters, Elena Maria,
who was six, and Guillerma Maria, who was
eighteen and very beautiful, lived in the Calle<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Cerrito, in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentine
Republic, South America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Francisco, himself, was nine, and his uncle
who was a colonel in the army and who supported
his widowed sister and her family,
expected him to be a soldier also. His great-grandfather
had been a general, and because of
his services during the revolution that had
brought Argentina her liberty nearly one hundred
years ago, his family was one of the most
distinguished in the Republic. Francisco's
own grandfather had given his life for his
<i>patria</i> during the ten years' blockade of Buenos
Aires, when the French and English forces
combined to overcome General Rosas, who
then commanded the city. His mother and his
uncle, the Colonel Juan Carlos Lacevera, were
then little children, but they were fired with a
patriotism that comes only to those who have
given of their own flesh and blood for native
land.</p>

<p>"El Coronel Lacevera" was now retired,
and with his wife and six daughters lived in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spacious, palatial home in the Calle San Martin
facing the beautiful plaza, or park, where the
statue of General San Martin on his rearing
charger stands, a constant reminder to the
hundreds of little Argentine boys and girls
who daily play in the pebbled space around it,
of the wonderful man, who, like George Washington,
was first in war, first in peace, and is
still first in the hearts of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The monthly allowance bestowed by Colonel
Lacevera upon his sister was enough to keep
them in comfort, but not sufficient to allow
them to live in luxury, and to-day, because
Francisco had not enough money to buy his
Christmas <i>pesebre</i> at the toyshop, he was doing
what many little boys of that country do,&mdash;he
was making his own.</p>

<p>Now, you must know right here, that Christmas
in these South American countries is not
the greatest festival of the entire year, as it is
with us; it is simply one of the many that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
celebrated at frequent intervals, for Argentina
is a land of <i>fiestas;</i> there is scarcely a month
that does not allow three or four holidays from
school because of some <i>fiesta</i>, either of church
or state. Although they do not celebrate this
great holiday as we do with Christmas trees
and visits from Santa Claus, they have something
in their places, and it is the "Coming of
the Three Kings." In anticipation of this, all
over the Republic, children erect <i>pesebres</i> or
mangers.</p>

<p>A <i>pesebre</i> consists of a miniature open shed,
or merely a roof of straw or bark, underneath
which, in a tiny box, lies a porcelain baby doll
to represent the infant Christ. Bending in
adoration at the head of the wee box that holds
this image kneels the mother, Mary, and at the
foot, with folded hands, stands Joseph, the
father. About them, placed in sand or moss,
that forms the floor of the stable or yard,
are figures to represent the worshipful neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
also the farm-yard fowls and animals;
cows and donkeys predominating. They look
like Noah's Ark people, stiff-legged and prim.
Now all of this remains unmoved, a spot of
reverent adoration, throughout Christmas week,
New Year's day, and until "twelfth night,"
or the fifth of January. It is awaiting the
great event for which it was erected, the
"Coming of the Three Kings."</p>

<p>On that auspicious night, through the same
magical means that aid Santa Claus to enter
the homes of North American children while
their eyes are closed in sleep, come the three
richly decorated and delicately carved kings
on miniature camels with costly trappings and
bags of spices on their little brown backs.</p>

<p>On the morning of the sixth of January the
children awake, all eagerness to see the arrivals
of the night. Rushing to the <i>pesebre</i> they find
the three little wooden kings kneeling beside
the manger, the faithful camels standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
grass without, and all about on the floor are
the wonderful gifts that the kings have brought
to their <i>pesebre</i>. Indeed, as you can see, it was
erected for just this purpose, exactly as the
fir tree with its glittering ornaments forms the
nucleus in other lands for Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>It was these wooden people and animals
that Francisco's small fingers were fashioning.
He had cut himself several times, and one
finger was bound up in an old handkerchief,
but his enthusiasm was not lessened because of
it. He knew exactly how they should be carved,
and how many there should be, for in the
toyshop windows there had been sets of them
on display for weeks, and Francisco had studied
each necessary bit carefully.</p>

<p>In a box beside him were the finished product
of his penknife. Joseph and Mary were completed
even to the paint; Mary's red and blue
gown and Joseph's yellow robe were not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dry, and the cows were too vividly red, but that
would not matter; Elena was no severe critic,
and it was mainly for her that he was carving
them. Elena had been ill and this was to be
her "getting well" gift. The flashing light
in her great brown eyes when she should see
them would be sufficient reward for cut fingers
and weary back. Besides, this was the summer
vacation and there was nothing else to
do.</p>

<p>In all countries on the other side of the
Equator the seasons are the reverse of those on
this side. In Argentina the children are having
their summer holidays in December, January,
and February, when the children of the Northern
hemisphere are busy in school, or skating and
sleighing; and they are having their winter
when the Northern children are dressed in
their thinnest clothing and are going away to
the seashore or mountains.</p>

<p>Francisco had just completed a wonderful
set of bent pin horns for one of the red cows
when he was called to breakfast, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<i>half-past eleven</i>. But you see their meal hours,
like their seasons, are different from ours. At
eight o'clock he had had his <i>cafe con leche</i>, or
coffee with hot milk, and a roll; at half-past
eleven he was accustomed to having his breakfast;
at four he would have <i>m√°te</i> or tea; and
at seven dinner would be served.</p>

<p>Francisco gathered his treasures into the
tin box, and hurried to the bath-room to make
himself ready for <i>almuerzo</i>. When he entered
the dining-room his mother and Guillerma, the
elder sister, were seated, and the little Indian
serving-maid was arranging a tray to carry to
Elena in the bed-room.</p>

<p>The meal consisted of beef broth and rice,
called <i>caldo</i> and the usual beginning to every
hearty meal in that country; then came fried
fish with garlic, followed by a stew of mutton,
carrots, cabbage, potatoes, and large pieces of
yellow pumpkin, this being the native dish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the Argentines and commonly known as <i>puchero</i>.
After that came fruit and coffee.</p>

<p>Guillerma chatted continuously of the wonderful
new gowns which she had seen being
packed at the great house in Calle San Martin,
where she had been the day before, to bid her
aunt and six cousins good-bye, before their
departure for Mar-de-la-Plata, the fashionable
watering place on the Atlantic Ocean, a day's
ride by rail from Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they sat thus, eating and talking,
over in the great house of the <i>Coronel</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the master sat at his massive library table
playing solitaire. He always ended his meals
thus with his after-dinner coffee-cup beside
him. The walls were lined with well-filled
bookcases, for the Colonel was a scholar.</p>

<p>Indeed, he cared little for the gay life that
ebbed and flowed about him because of his high
social position, and because of the six comely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
daughters, ranging from fourteen to twenty-four;
the eldest ones of whom were favourites
in exclusive Buenos Aires society. He suffered
it because of his love for them, but his natural
fondness for quiet and study led him to think
longingly of the large estate in the Province of
Santa F√©, where he could spend the remaining
years of his life in the free open air, enjoying
the quiet and solitude he so loved. But the
daughters must be educated and their mother
did not like the country, so the Colonel was
forced to live through the winter months in the
noise and roar of the great city; contenting
himself with a few months each summer at the
estate, when he rode at will over the wide
prairies on his swift Argentine horse, or read
for hours under the shade of the wide spreading
<i>omb√∫</i> trees which surrounded the country house.
This <i>est√°ncia</i>, as they term a very large farm
or ranch, was really his wife's; in fact, so was
the city house, for no retired colonel's pay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
nor general's pay, for that matter, could have
met the expenses of his large family, accustomed
to every luxury; indeed, it was just enough to
cover his own personal expenses, and provide
a living for his widowed sister, who had been
left penniless, but dared not earn her own
living, since the custom of the country forbids
women of class to do work of any kind.</p>

<p>His matronly wife with her six daughters
(large families are the rule among these Latin
Americans) had left the evening before, with
several French maids, for Mar-de-la-Plata to
spend the entire summer; he would be detained
in the city for two weeks, and then&mdash;for
freedom and the life he loved.</p>

<p>But he was strangely lonely; the house
echoed his and the servants' footfalls with an
intensity that made him nervous; the pillared
corridors rang with no merry girlish laughter,
and the luxuriantly furnished <i>patio</i> with its
marble floors, and softly pattering fountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seemed to mock him of his loneliness. Always
before, he had left for the <i>est√°ncia</i> before his
family had gone to Europe or the seashore for
their summer outing, and he never would have
believed that he&mdash;an old soldier&mdash;could be
so overcome by sentiment.</p>

<p>He was minded to take up his abode for the
next two weeks, previous to his leaving for the
country, in his widowed sister's humble home,
when the splendid thought came to him;&mdash;he
would bring Francisco, his nephew, there
with him to the lonely house.</p>

<p>For some time he had been drawn towards
the little fellow, partly because his heart was
desolate that he had no son of his own, partly
because the boy was developing so many manly
traits, and reminded him frequently, when he
turned his round brown eyes towards him, of
his own long since fallen soldier father.</p>

<p>He desired to know him better, to get closer
to the lad&mdash;and now this was his opportunity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he would ask Anita to let him have Francisco
for the summer, and the boy would keep the
empty house lively for the few days until they
should both leave for his Tres Arroyas ranch.
He clapped his hands sharply, and a servant
appeared.</p>

<p>"Have Enrique bring the motor car at four,
when the afternoon is cooler," he ordered,
and turned to his bed-room for the <i>siesta</i>, or
rest, that all tropical and semitropical climates
demand of their residents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A WONDERFUL DAY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Promptly</span> at four, the huge red machine
puffed up to the front curbing. The Colonel
was walking up and down in the Plaza opposite,
smoking a cigarette; for when not eating or
asleep, an Argentine gentleman is seldom seen
without the thin, white <i>cigarrillo</i> between his
lips. He looked most distinguished in his
scarlet and green uniform.</p>

<p>It took but a few moments to reach his
sister's <i>casa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the maid who answered his
ring in the narrow vestibule that opened directly
onto the street told him the family were having
<i>m√°te</i> in the <i>patio</i>, which was partly shaded in
the late afternoon. He was welcomed heartily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and was kissed by each one twice, after the
foreign fashion, once on either cheek.</p>

<p>The <i>m√°te</i> cup, an egg-shaped gourd, was
passed from hand to hand as they sat talking,
each one in turn sucking the fragrant tea
through the same silver tube; the little Indian
maid refilling the gourd again and again with
hot water.</p>

<p>This is the universal custom in South American
countries below the Equator, and aside
from the benefits derived from the drinking
of the pungent herb itself, it has a significance
akin to the "loving cup" idea, and is a symbolization
of family love and domestic ties.</p>

<p>A guest is always asked to partake of <i>m√°te</i>
with the family, and if he is unaccustomed to
the manner of its usage, the fact that he is
expected to obtain his share by means of the
one, universal tube, is at first disconcerting, but
he dare not refuse under penalty of offending
his host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>This herb is called "Paraguayian tea," or
"Jesuits' tea," as it was used extensively by
the early Jesuit Fathers, who were one of the
most important factors in the civilization of
the lower half of South America. It is grown
mostly in Brazil and Paraguay and its cultivation
has become quite an industry.</p>

<p>The dried leaves are placed in a small gourd,
hot water is poured into it, and it is then sucked
into the mouth through the long silver tube,
which has a bulbous end, perforated with small
holes so that the tea is strained. At the first
taste it is exceedingly bitter, but one soon grows
very fond of it. It is very stimulating and a
<i>gaucho</i>, or cowboy, will sometimes, under
stress of circumstances, ride all day with only
his morning gourd of <i>m√°te</i> to sustain him, and
then eat his first meal of the day at sundown.</p>

<p>The Colonel soon made known his errand,
and Francisco was beside himself with joy.
He danced about the <i>patio</i> clapping his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and then ran indoors to sick Elena to smother
her with kisses, and to tell her of his good
fortune.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elena, just think of it! Two whole
weeks in the big <i>casa</i> with servants, horses and
automobiles&mdash;and then two whole months in
the <i>campo</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with uncle to ride with me, and
teach me something new every day!"</p>

<p>"But Elena mia, you will miss me," and
a note of sadness crept into his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Francisco, I shall miss you, but I
shall enjoy myself every day thinking of what
you are doing, and you will write to me; Mam√°
will read me your letters, and then there will
be so much to talk about when you return,"&mdash;and
Francisco embraced her another time.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, clean and shining in his
best suit of clothes, exchanged for the long linen
duster that all Argentine schoolboys wear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
play in, he was spinning along the asphalt
streets, sitting beside the man who stood, to
his young mind, for every virtue assigned to
his patron saint.</p>

<p>At first he was slightly shy, for this wonderful
soldier uncle had never paid any particular
attention to him, so engrossed was he always
with his books and his family; but as they
threaded their way in and out the traffic-crowded
streets, among the heavy carts, the
noisily clanging electric tram-cars, and low,
open victorias filled with elaborately dressed
women, and fleet wheeled automobiles of every
size and class, Francisco began to ask questions,
and forgot his timidity. They were soon
chatting interestedly.</p>

<p>"How would you like a spin out to Palermo?"
his uncle asked, as they reached the central
part of the city.</p>

<p>"Better than I could say," replied the happy
lad; his heart meanwhile bounding, for he
seldom saw the trees and flowers of the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
park that is one of the city's most picturesque
attractions.</p>

<p>"Then, Enrique&mdash;to the park, via the
<i>Avenida<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Alvear</i>," said Colonel Lacevera to
the chauffeur.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon now, and being Thursday,
the broad avenues were filled with hundreds
of vehicles; since Thursday and Sunday are
the afternoons chosen by fashionable Buenos
Aires for the diversion of riding or driving to
the great Prado to hear the military band, and
to mingle in the long lines of carriages and
motor cars.</p>

<p>The <i>Avenida Alvear</i>, broad and smoothly
paved, with its magnificent residences on either
side, makes a desirable avenue from which to
approach the park. As they rode along, the
odour of jasmine and roses hung heavy about
them, coming from the beautiful gardens surrounding
the palatial homes. Long arbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of American Beauty roses, looking like crimson
lined tunnels; majestic palm trees, over which
trailed Marechal Niel roses and cypress vines;
bulky shrubs, with sweet scents; all these lent
their charm to the scene, and Francisco, ever
alive to the beauties of nature, felt this to be a
foretaste of Paradise.</p>

<p>Soon they were in the palm bordered drives
of the park; but they crept along at a snail's
pace, as the speed on crowded afternoons is
limited to a funeral pace, in order that the lines
of carriages both coming and going may avoid
confusion.</p>

<p>Through the trees and shrubbery Francisco
caught glimpses of cool running streams,
crossed by rustic bridges; clear, limpid lakes
with swans and boats, and here and there,
pavilions where ices and <i>refrescos</i> were being
enjoyed by the gay crowd. At intervals, on
splendid black horses, were stationed picturesque
looking mounted policemen, their
long horsehair plumes trailing over their shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from which hung scarlet lined capes. It
was their duty to keep the half dozen columns
of vehicles in proper line.</p>

<p>The Colonel's car had entered the wide area
of the Avenue Sarmiento when he leaned towards
the chauffeur and said, "Turn towards the
Zoological Gardens, Enrique." And then, to
the boy beside him, he said, "How could you
stand half an hour in the Zoological Gardens,
Ni√±o?"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"I would try to bear up under it, Uncle,"
replied Francisco, as his eyes twinkled an answer
to the merriment in the older man's. They
alighted at the curbing, and entered the immense
iron gates into that Mecca of all Argentine
boyish hearts.</p>

<p>All of this seemed as a dream to Francisco
for although his mother had frequently brought
him here, she knew little of the animals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
birds; and now with Uncle Juan he could ask
questions innumerable without getting the reply:
<i>Yo no se</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>They paused first at the great cage, fifty
feet in height and covering an area of half a
city block, built over a small artificial mountain
where hundreds of eagles and condors wheeled,
fought and chattered.</p>

<p>"See the pavilion that looks like a Hindoo
temple, Francisco; let us see what animal
makes that its home."</p>

<p>"Elephants, Uncle Juan, and perhaps we
can see the baby elephant that was born here
a few weeks ago." Sure enough, in a park all
their own, surrounding the Hindoo temple
house, was a family of elephants and the baby
elephant stood beside its mother, who was
rubbing it affectionately with her long trunk.</p>

<p>The alpacas, llamas, deer, bison, guanacos
and vicu√±as came next, and Uncle Juan could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
answer every question that the eager boy put
to him, for, during his active service in the
army, he had spent much time on the frontier,
and on the Cordilleras of the Andes, where
these animals are found.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="boy riding very small llama" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE PERMITTED FRANCISCO TO TAKE A RIDE ON THE TAME
LLAMA&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He permitted Francisco to take a ride on the
tame llama, who rivalled the Lilliputian steam
engine in its popularity as a mode of progression
around the garden. As it did not trot, but
walked sleepily along with Francisco, having
served all day, no doubt, as a vehicle for children
visiting the "Zoo," Uncle Juan walked beside
him, and, as they proceeded, he told him much
about the small camel-like animal upon whose
back he rode.</p>

<p>"You see, Ni√±o, a llama is almost like a
camel, but its size and strength are inferior.
It has no hump on its back, but as you saw
when you mounted it, it kneels like one. They
thrive best at a high elevation where they browse
on reeds, lichens, mosses and grass. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
grass is succulent they can go without water
for a long time. When they are domesticated
it is for their fine fleece. Their flesh when young
is deliciously tender, and it is then that they
can be caught with dogs and a lasso, but the
old ones can only be shot at a distance, and
their flesh is fit only to be dried and salted. I
have seen them in Per√∫ used as beasts of
burden, and the Indians make a very beautiful
and valuable cloth from the soft fleece. But
come, lad, the sun sinks, and we may come here
another time."</p>

<p>As they walked towards the gate where the
car was awaiting them, they passed lakes where
waded and swam many birds of brilliant
plumage. Herons and flamingoes, red and
gray and pink, stood on one leg, lazily, watching
for minnows.</p>

<p>"Why are some of the flamingoes scarlet and
some pink?" asked Francisco.</p>

<p>"Those with red plumage are the old ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and the delicate rose coloured ones are not yet
in their second year. At old Roman feasts
their tongues were considered the greatest
delicacy; I have eaten their flesh roasted, and
it is wonderfully palatable."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, we haven't seen the lions, nor
the bears, nor the monkeys, nor the boa-constrictors,"
coaxed Francisco, as they came
in sight of the gates.</p>

<p>"But we shall see them another time, Ni√±o.
We cannot see the half of these great gardens
in a day, for they cover many acres, and contain
the finest specimens of any garden on the continent."
As they passed out the bugles at the
military post opposite were sounding for the
soldiers' dinner and the avenues were no longer
crowded.</p>

<p>"With haste now, to the <i>casa</i>," ordered the
Colonel, and the enormous car plunged ahead,
along the deserted boulevards where the electric
lights were beginning to appear one by one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Francisco had never flown so fast and he
cuddled close into his uncle's arm; the strong
man held him tenderly, lovingly, and they
entered the electric lighted <i>patio</i> of the <i>casa</i>
arm in arm.</p>

<p>Now the Colonel's home was not unlike
many others of its class, but to the little lad's
eyes it seemed a palace. The main part of it
was perfectly square, and built around an inner
court from which many of the rooms were
lighted and all were entered. The windows
facing the street were heavily barred, and small
balconies of wrought iron projected from each
window, over-hanging the pavement a few feet
below. The house was flat and of but
one story; into this first court opened luxuriously
furnished parlours, drawing-rooms,
smoking-rooms and library. Behind all of this
was another court with smaller rooms opening
into it, exactly like a smaller house. Into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this opened all the bed-rooms, the bath-rooms
and the long elegantly furnished dining-room.</p>

<p>Quite separate, and reached by a rear street
entrance, was yet another, a third court or
<i>patio</i>, and into this opened the pantries, kitchen
and servants' quarters. The walls of the high
spacious parlours were richly decorated, and
the chandeliers were of silver and crystal;
while ornaments and valuable souvenirs from
all parts of the world were displayed throughout
the entire house.</p>

<p>Although only Francisco and the Colonel
sat at dinner that night, the table was lavishly
decorated, and the cut glass, silver and dinner
of many courses, including fish, game, meats,
vegetables and fruits, were a source of constant
bewilderment and admiration to the boy accustomed
to humbler fare and less luxurious
surroundings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LESSON IN HISTORY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Francisco</span> awoke very early the next morning,
for he was unaccustomed to sleeping away
from home. He lay quite still listening to
the unwonted sounds. He heard the servants
scrubbing the marble floors of the <i>patio</i> and
corridors; he heard the call of the <i>panadero</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and the hurrying feet to answer; for no private
family ever bakes its own bread in Argentina,
and the bakers have it all their own way, which
isn't a very bad way since their bread is light
and deliciously crisp; he heard the chattering
of the parrots and paroquets in the servants'
<i>patio;</i> then the clatter of a squad of mounted
policemen on their way to the day's duty, the
hoofs of their horses beating a tattoo of haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on the smooth asphalt still wet with the daybreak
bath of the sprinkling carts.</p>

<p>Then he became interested in his room.
Such luxury as surrounded him! He sat up in
bed and rubbed his eyes, for he had never
viewed these bed-rooms except from the corridor,
on his infrequent visits to the house. His bed
was heavily carved and overhung with a canopy
of pale blue plush and silk; the walls were
panelled and painted in delicate colours, with
angels and cherubs everywhere; huge mirrors
reflected each other as they hung in their
frames of Florentine gold, and after he had
viewed it all for a few moments, he buried his
head in his pillow and wished for his own bare
room and his mother. Then he longed for
Elena that she might enjoy the beauties about
him; and this reminded him of the <i>pesebre</i>,
which was still unfinished, but which he had
brought with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>He wondered how he could get it to her
without her finding out&mdash;and&mdash;he must have
fallen into a doze, for soon he heard an imitation
<i>reveille</i> blown through human hands, outside
the closed blinds that shaded his door into the
corridor, and his uncle called good-naturedly:
"A pretty time for a soldier of the Republic
to get up!"</p>

<p>Francisco hurried into his clothes and found
the Colonel taking his coffee and rolls in a
shaded corner of the <i>patio</i>.</p>

<p>"I am going to give you all of my time to-day,
Ni√±o, as I feel lazy, and I find there are many
things here in your own native city that you
know nothing about, and that a boy of nine
should see and learn. Your mother could not
be expected to do it, so it falls to me. We must
start immediately, before the heat of the day
drives us indoors. Get your cap, lad, and we
will start over in the Plaza San Mart√≠n opposite,
and have a lesson in history."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>They donned their hats, and Francisco felt
very proud to walk beside his uncle, who, if
not a very large man in stature, loomed up big
before the boy's worshipful eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you know of Buenos Aires, Ni√±o?"
he asked as they sauntered towards the centre
of the park.</p>

<p>"Not much, Uncle Juan. I know it is the
largest city on the South American continent,
and that it has over one million inhabitants.
My teacher said once that it is one of the largest
produce markets in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there is much more. It is the
largest Spanish speaking city in the world, as
it is twice as large as Madrid, the capital of
Spain. But it is also very cosmopolitan."</p>

<p>"I don't think I know just what that means,
Uncle Juan."</p>

<p>"Cosmopolitan? Why that, in this case,
means that there are many nationalities represented
in Buenos Aires. There are thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Italians, Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen
and Russians; and one can hear half a dozen
different languages in an hour's time walking
along the streets. But, to-day, I want to start
with a little history of our country. So let us
sit here on this bench and begin. At this early
hour we will not be disturbed."</p>

<p>They sat down almost under the shadow of
the high statue of San Mart√≠n and the Colonel
reverently uncovered his head. Without being
told, Francisco took off his cap, and his uncle
patted him affectionately on the back. "Good,
good, my boy! He deserves it, for no greater
soldier ever fought; but we will have to go
back several centuries to get the run of things,"
and as he leaned back he paused and puffed thin
clouds of smoke from his cigarette.</p>

<p>"You see, when Buenos Aires was really
founded, it was in 1580, sixty-four years after
the River Plate was discovered by Solis, who
called it the River of Silver, because he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
silver could be found on its banks. They
called the city 'Good Airs,' because of the
fresh, invigorating quality of the air that blew
over from the vast prairies. This first settlement
grew, and others farther into the interior
sprang from it; all of them Spanish settlements;
and in 1661 the King of Spain recognized
them as a colony and appointed a governor.
Thus it continued until in 1806, when England
was at war with Spain, and they sent Lord
Beresford, with several thousand men, down
to this colony to take possession of it.</p>

<p>"Buenos Aires then, as now, was the key to
the entire country, and as it had but forty
thousand inhabitants, and was without any
military defence, he took it without trouble.
But the Spaniards, at last, overcame him;
and he was obliged to give up his prize and
leave. England then sent another army, but
this time the natives were prepared, and their
victory was complete. General Whitelock, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
command, capitulated, and his flag, the flag
of the famous Seventy-First Regiment of the
British army, hangs in the Cathedral over
yonder, where you see the double spires beyond
the house-tops. We are justly proud of that
flag, for that Seventy-First Regiment is the one
that caused Napoleon no end of trouble in
Egypt.</p>

<p>"After this victory our people began to feel
the stirrings of independence from Spain itself,
and a spirit of revolution took hold of the officials
and people. At last, an open revolt took place
in the Plaza Mayo, on the twenty-fifth day of
May, 1810, and under the leadership of splendid
men&mdash;patriots all of them&mdash;our independence
was declared.</p>

<p>"But this was only the first step, just as it
was with the great republic of the United States
when on the fourth of July they declared their
independence from England. So our twenty-fifth
of May was but the beginning of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
long struggle. A <i>Junta</i> was formed to govern,
but it was no easy task. To the north were
Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia; to the west
Chile and Per√∫; all Spanish colonies. The
<i>Junta</i> sent troops to these countries to endeavour
to arouse the people to throw off
the yoke. They sent General Belgrano to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Belgrano! I know about him, Uncle.
His tomb is in the little square in front
of the church in Calle Defensa, and it was he
who originated our flag. He said the long blue
bars were to represent our faithfulness, as true
as the beautiful blue of our skies; and the
white bar was to symbolize our honour, spotless
and fair."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, he went first to Paraguay; but
the Spaniards had so intermarried with the
Paraguayan Indians, whom they had found
in that wild country, that they did not respond
to the stirring appeal of General Belgrano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He, however, succeeded in some of the northern
provinces, and thus encouraged, they organized
a small navy. Do you know who was our
first admiral? No? Well, it was an Englishman
and his name was William Brown.</p>

<p>"With this navy, Montivideo, the capital of
Uruguay, was taken. Enthusiasm ran high,
and it was just here that Don Jos√© de San
Mart√≠n came into the light of publicity, as
commander-in-chief of the army. Now let
us take the automobile, awaiting us over in
front of the house, and ride to the Cathedral
where the remains of our hero rest, and I will
tell you more about him there."</p>

<p>They rode along the clean streets, the fresh
morning air blowing straight into their faces,
the curious, sing-song cries of the street venders
following them as they sped along Calle
Florida.</p>

<p>"Uncle Juan, why is it that most of these
street peddlers are Italians? See, there goes
an onion-man with his long strings of onions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their stalks knit together into yard lengths;
there is a vegetable cart; there is a vender of
fruit, and all of them speaking broken Spanish
with an Italian accent."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ni√±o, most of the peddlers are Italian.
I do not know why, unless it is that each
nationality turns to a special kind of work in
this world. The Italians are naturally merchants,
they like to bargain. They are also
very fine mechanics. Did you ever notice that
our plasterers, or masons, who plaster the
outside and inside of all our houses, speak
Italian?"</p>

<p>"And that group of men on the corner, see,
Uncle, they are all dressed alike, and must be
of the same nationality; what are they?"</p>

<p>"Those"&mdash;indicating half a dozen men
wearing full trousers held up by red sashes,
adorned with dozens of coins, their heads
covered with round full caps also red. "Those
are Basques or Vascongados. There are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
here, and they come from a small piece of
country to the west end of the Pyrenees, in
Spain, bordering the Bay of Biscay. Like the
Italians, they, too, follow the work best suited
to them, and they are mostly porters, because
of their physical strength and powers of endurance.</p>

<p>"I have noticed, too, that the majority of
our milk men are Basques, and I account for
that because in their native home they are a
pastoral people and such pursuits attract them.
Listen as we pass: their language is unintelligible
to us although they come from Spain. It is
unlike any other European language."</p>

<p>They were now entering the great square
called Plaza Mayo. It is the heart of the city,
although it is not in the centre. It covers about
ten acres, and is two blocks back from the
muddy La Plata River; and scores of masts and
smoke-belching funnels of great ocean vessels
can be seen from its benches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is our Government House. That
much I know," said Francisco, pointing to the
rose-tinted building, modelled after the Tuileries,
and facing the plaza. From its rear to
the river intervened grass plots and groves of
sturdy palmettoes.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is where our Senate convenes and
where all the business of the Republic is done.
The President has his offices there, and all
the public receptions are held there. You see,
our government does not provide a home for our
President; that, he must look after himself.
Why, we are just in time to see His Excellency
now."</p>

<p>There was a clatter of hoofs under the wide
<i>porte-cochere</i> and a smart closed coupe drew up
before the side entrance. The liveried footman
with a cockade of blue and white (the Argentine
colours) in his high hat sprang to the ground
and opened the door. A man, slightly above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the usual Argentine height, quite handsome,
with pure Castilian features, and dressed in
afternoon garb of tall silk hat and frock coat,
got out, and walked spryly up the wide stone
steps, past the sentries in scarlet and green,
into the vestibule.</p>

<p>"Do you know him, Uncle Juan?" asked
Francisco, with awe in his voice.</p>

<p>"Se√±or Alcorta, El Presidente, is a warm
friend of mine," replied the Colonel, and as he
said it he grew fully half a foot in his nephew's
estimation.</p>

<p>"A warm friend? Do tell me about him."</p>

<p>"Another time, Ni√±o, we must hasten to
yonder Cathedral; but he is a good man and
a good President."</p>

<p>They turned towards the enormous building,
shaped like the Pantheon with its blue tile-covered
cupola, and its long portico supported
by huge Corinthian columns.</p>

<p>It was built by the Jesuits in the seventeenth
century and hundreds of Indians were employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by these pioneer fathers, in its construction.
Like all houses in Buenos Aires, it is of masonry
untinted except by years. With the Bishop's
palace next to it, it covers an acre of ground.</p>

<p>Francisco and his uncle entered it and
crossing themselves, knelt on the bare stone
floor, for like most Argentines, they were
Catholics, and this was their greatest cathedral.
After a few minutes spent in devotion, the
Colonel led the way to one of the naves, where
the tomb of the great liberator, San Mart√≠n,
stands, a huge sarcophagus upon a high pedestal
of marble. The Colonel stood in meditation a
moment, then drew the boy beside him on a
bench. In a low voice he said:</p>

<p>"Francisco, San Mart√≠n, the father of our
country, was not only a great general, but he
was also a remarkable organizer, for his troops
were composed mainly of <i>gauchos</i> of the wild
uncivilized kind, who were not easily trained or
drilled. It was he who originated the plan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
crossing the Andes and liberating Chile and
Per√∫ from the Spanish yoke.</p>

<p>"With his army of five thousand men, and in
the face of public derision, for the undertaking
seemed impossible, he crossed the rugged
Cordilleras in twenty-five days; met the Spanish
general in charge of Chile and defeated him.
He was thus the liberator of the Chilean people,
for that battle on the twelfth of February, 1817,
gave them their independence from Spain. In
Santiago, Chile, there is a statue to General
San Mart√≠n, and one to the city of Buenos
Aires. After his wonderful achievement in
crushing the power of Spain, in Argentina,
Chile and Per√∫, he retired to private life,
refusing to serve in any civil capacity.</p>

<p>"Following this revolutionary triumph, Brazil
waged war with the Argentine Republic over
the disposition of Uruguay. After three years,
they agreed on its independence. This was
followed by a dictatorship lasting twenty years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that was a period of the greatest tyranny in
our history. Don Juan Manuel Ortiz de Rosas,
at the head of a powerful troop of half savage
<i>gauchos</i>, appeared on the political stage, and
literally wrested the reins of government from
Dorrego, who held them.</p>

<p>"Some time you will read in history of his
twenty years of despotism. It was during this
reign that my father, your maternal grandfather,
lost his life in the blockade of Argentine ports,
by French and English forces. Rosas was at
last overthrown by General Urquiza, who
organized the government upon its first solid
basis, with a constitution modelled closely after
that of the United States of North America.
Since then, although we have had a few revolutions
and several financial crises, we have maintained
our freedom; and our wonderful natural
resources and our rapid commercial development
are giving us a stable place in the world's
congress of nations."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Francisco listened attentively, and when his
uncle concluded, followed him out a side
entrance into the street, like one in a dream.
They stepped into the Calle Bartolom√©
Mitre, which seemed congested with a torrent
of vehicles pouring down its narrow channel
like a noisy stream and discharging itself
into the great Plaza in front of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>"What if San Mart√≠n could see this now?"
ventured Francisco, still under the spell of
the hero's achievements. "Wouldn't he open
his eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lad, the growth of this city has been
phenomenal, and this afternoon I will show you
more of it. Why, you're not homesick, are
you?" he asked, noticing the far away look in
the boy's eyes as they sped along the <i>Avenida</i>.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but I would like to see Elena,
and find out how she is to-day."</p>

<p>"Why, bless my heart! I had forgotten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sick sister. We will go past thy mother's house
and if the little rose is well enough this afternoon,
we shall include her in our ride in the
city."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CURIOUS SIGHTS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elena</span> was propped up with pillows in a
deep chair by the window which opened out
upon the street. She looked lonely, but when
she saw the car sweep along the street and stop
at their door, her face beamed happily. There
was no jealousy in Elena's heart because her
brother was being thus favoured by their
uncle.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elena, mia," cried Francisco, throwing
his arms about her, and kissing her on each pale
cheek. "Do you feel able to take a ride with
us this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I think she is," answered his mother, entering
the room, and taking her son into a close
embrace. "But how I have missed my Ni√±o,
Juan," turning to her brother, the Colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been selfish in taking him
from you, Anita. Shall I leave him here?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no! The lad needs you, Juan. He
has no father to teach him as he should be
taught. It is the very opportunity for him;
and I am most pleased. Only, let me see him
often, and I shall be content."</p>

<p>"That you shall, and this afternoon just
after <i>m√°te</i>, we will come to take you and Elena
with us for a ride. It may bring roses to her
cheeks," and he pinched the pale cheeks as he
passed her on his way out.</p>

<p>True to their promise, at five o'clock the
automobile drew up in front of Francisco's
home and the Colonel, himself, carried Elena
out to it, and placed her in the nest of pillows
on the broad leather seat. Her mother followed
and before Elena realized it, they were
speeding toward the central part of the city.</p>

<p>"Where does the little White Rose wish to
go?" inquired her uncle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere&mdash;away from this horrid
street. I am so tired of it. If I may, I should
love to see the water."</p>

<p>"To the river, Enrique," laughingly ordered
her uncle. "Only, the river isn't a very pretty
sheet of water. It is so murky, and I think
should be called the River of Bronze rather
than the River of Silver."</p>

<p>"I know, Uncle Juan; but when I had the
fever it was water, water, water I dreamt of,
and now I want to see my fill of it."</p>

<p>"That you shall, White Rose, for right here
at Buenos Aires the river is over twenty-five
miles wide and the city has a frontage of four
miles along the waterfront."</p>

<p>They passed through the Plaza Mayo, and
Francisco had to tell Elena of having seen el
Presidente that morning. Then they turned
into the Paseo-de-Julio, a one-sided boulevard
facing the river two blocks away. The intervening
space was a maze of small plazas where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
palms, flowers, shrubs and statuary edge the
waterfront like a band of solid green. Beyond,
before Elena could see the water, were the busy
docks, huge masonry basins, where over two
thousand ocean-going vessels come and go
during the span of a year.</p>

<p>Electric cranes were swinging the great
cargoes of wheat and cattle into the yawning
holds of the vessels, and on and on the sea of
funnels and masts stretched until the muddy
line of water at last broke on the sight. Francisco
was alert, his brown eyes taking in every
detail of the stirring busy scene; but Elena's
hungry eyes looked past this to the water
beyond.</p>

<p>"Some day, I hope to go away in one of those
big vessels," she announced.</p>

<p>"Indeed, and which one will you choose,
little White Rose? Here is a wide choice. That
large one with the enormous smokestacks and
the British flag flying above her, is a Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Mail Steam-ship from England. One of these
leaves every Friday for England, and besides the
mail, carries about fifteen hundred passengers.
On one of them you would travel in great luxury;
electric fans, electric elevators, an orchestra
with dances every evening, and dressing for
dinner at night. Oh! it's gay enough, the
life on those magnificent steamers!</p>

<p>"Then, alongside of it you see a smaller
boat, a French liner from Marseilles. They go
weekly also, and they bring us our champagne
and our opera companies; why, this very
automobile came on one of them. There's an
Italian liner and just beyond are some German
boats. In the South Dock is a river boat that
goes up country to Paraguay; our oranges
come on those. And all about are smaller
boats, some sailing vessels that carry coffee
from Brazil, and yellow pine from New Orleans
in the United States."</p>

<p>"Why, that one just over yonder flies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Stars and Stripes of North America," cried
Francisco, pointing to a small vessel.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Ni√±o. It is from <i>Los Estados
Unidos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> You must not confound them, for
the United States are but a part of North
America, although many of our people do not
seem to think so. But you do not see many
of their flags in our docks. The commercial
relations between our two countries are as yet
in their infancy. The most of our export and
import business is done with Europe."</p>

<p>"Do they not send anything at all down here,
but yellow pine, Uncle?" this from Francisco.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh! yes. They are sending us
machinery, especially agricultural machinery.
When you go with me to the country you will
see their wind-mills, steam threshers and binders
in great quantities. They send us other
machinery, of many kinds, but in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with our trade with Germany and England it
is very little."</p>

<p>"And do these big ships go back empty to
Europe?" inquired Elena, pointing to the
long wharves.</p>

<p>"By no means, little girl. See those heavy
carts going towards the docks? Well, I don't
suppose your young mind can take in the figures,
but Francisco will understand, when I tell you,
those carts carried one hundred and fifty
million bushels of wheat last year to those
returning ships, to say nothing of millions of
sheep, frozen quarters of beef, wool, cheese
and even butter and eggs. Anita," turning to
his sister, "I doubt if you, yourself, have ever
been to the Barracas, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, Juan. It is so far from the residence
district and I never happened to drive that
way."</p>

<p>"Then we will ride over there now and let
you all see the largest wholesale produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
market under one roof that you can find in
all the world."</p>

<p>For two miles they sped through narrow
streets; past crowded tenements, in front of
which scores of dirty children quarrelled and
played, and where the <i>peons</i> or working classes
huddle, sometimes families of fourteen in one
room; past <i>tambos</i>, where the cows and goats
stand in sheds, open to the street, awaiting to
be milked while the customer waits; past
gray spired churches, their wide doors always
open, inviting the pious passer-by to enter for
prayer; passed <i>fideos</i> factories, where curious
shaped macaroni hangs drying in the sun in
the open courtyards; on and on they bumped,
for the streets here were cobble-stones, until,
at last, they reached the vast building covering
many acres, where wheat, wool, corn and
produce are bought and sold to the foreign
trade.</p>

<p>"Were it not so late, we would alight and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it closer. However, Elena could not walk,
anyhow. Already, I fear she has had too long
a ride for her strength, and we hope not to tire
her on this, her first outing; eh, White Rose?"
But Elena was fast asleep, her head on her
mother's shoulder.</p>

<p>The chauffeur turned the car towards the
city, where here and there, in the gathering
dusk, an electric light could be seen as if notifying
the day, by these advance signals, that its duty
was over.</p>

<p>Elena slept on and did not see the wonderful
<i>Avenida</i> as they flew along its smooth surface,
so like Paris as to seem a bit of that gay city
picked up and transferred to American soil;
the plane trees bordering it, with here and there
a small newspaper <i>kiosk</i> like a miniature
temple; the splendid building of "La Prensa,"
the richest newspaper in the world, where
the Buenos Aires public can obtain the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the best doctors, lawyers, or dentists free
of charge; invitingly odorous confectioneries
or restaurants with small tables on the sidewalks
at which handsomely dressed men and
women sit eating and drinking and watching
the gay multitude; bewildering shop windows
full of the latest Parisian novelties; fruit and
flower boys, with their trays of luscious fruits
and delicately scented blossoms balanced unaided
on their heads; hotels just beginning to
glitter with their myriads of electric lights;
all of these passed by them as Elena slept the
sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Francisco, however, missed none of it, for
his was the Latin spirit full of love of pleasure
and display, bright lights and gay crowds.
His uncle watched him intently from under his
heavy brows.</p>

<p>Suddenly a weird, unearthly wail arose
above the hum of the traffic all around. Elena
started up, frightened and trembling, but, as
she had heard it before, she recognized it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and fell back asleep again. Francisco had
heard it also, but never so close, it seemed
right beside him.</p>

<p>"Uncle, may we not go back by the
Prensa building and see what has happened?"
he cried excitedly.</p>

<p>The Colonel agreed and Enrique crossed to
the other side of the street, entering the long
line of vehicles going west, for the "rule of
the road" in Argentina is "keep to the left."
The hoarse, wailing steam whistle had drawn
the crowds towards the handsome building
from whose tower it was issuing, and they
could not reach it within half a block. Mounted
policemen were everywhere trying to disperse
the crowd. It was good-natured as any Latin
crowd, but refused to be moved; like a hot
water bag, it bulged out in one spot when pressed
down in another. And all of this&mdash;because
the bulletin methods of this mighty newspaper
are so unusual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever any unexpected occurrence takes
place in Europe or any part of the world this
enterprising "daily" apprises the public of
it by blowing this stridently piercing steam
whistle. It was blown when Queen Victoria
passed away; its howl distressed the nervous
citizens when San Francisco was almost in
ashes, and its present message was that a son
and heir had been born to the King and Queen
of Spain. This was made known from the
front steps of the building and very soon the
crowd was a cheering, hat-waving mob. It
was momentarily growing more excited and
Enrique turned into a side street and sped
towards the house in Calle Cerrito, where
Elena, now thoroughly aroused by the boisterous
tumult about them, could be tucked away
into bed.</p>

<p>As Francisco and el Coronel Lacevera sat
at dinner that evening discussing the event
of the afternoon, while softly gliding servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in quiet livery served them, the Colonel
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you know, Ni√±o, that every time
La Prensa blows that whistle as they did to-day,
it costs them three hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Juan, does it use up as much
steam as that?" earnestly inquired Francisco.</p>

<p>"Scarcely," laughed the Colonel, as he lifted
up an enormous bunch of muscatel grapes,
weighing several pounds, from the platter of
fruit before him, "scarcely that, Ni√±o, but
our city government fines them that amount
every time they blow it, as they term it a public
nuisance. Now, when they want to indulge in
this sensational advertising, they send a messenger
on to the <i>Commissaria</i> post haste to
deposit the fine, timing his arrival just as the
last howl of the whistle sounds across the
city."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GREAT SURPRISES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Colonel's desk the little revolving
calendar was set at "December 25th," and the
letters were in red ink, showing by this that it
was a feast day. The Colonel was writing, and
evidently did not notice a little figure clad in
a long linen coat standing behind his chair
waiting a chance to speak. He wrote on and
on, until Francisco's patience was exhausted
and he coughed warningly.</p>

<p>"Not much of a soldier, Ni√±o! A soldier
must have patience if it is to wait all day."</p>

<p>But Francisco was used by now to his uncle's
chaffing; indeed, they were close friends and
Francisco went right to the heart of his errand.</p>

<p>"Uncle, it's <i>El dia de Navidad</i>."</p>

<p>"Why, so it is," looking at the calendar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"I had forgotten it was Christmas. We've
so many feast days one cannot keep the run of
all, and I can scarcely remember my own patron
saint's day. If it wasn't such a well known and
widely observed one, it would often pass before
I knew it."</p>

<p>Francisco laughed. "Why, Uncle Juan, you
couldn't miss St. John's day unless you were
deaf and blind. They make such a noise and
have such huge bonfires always. For weeks
before it comes the children save every piece
of wood and paper, and last St. John's night
I stood on our roof and looked over the city.
My! how pretty it looked; the whole city
seemed on fire; for nearly every street had
half a dozen bonfires. I wish <i>my</i> saint was as
popular. But to-day, I want to ask if I may
go home just for a little while."</p>

<p>"Indeed you may, lad, whenever you choose."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, to-day, I've a special errand,
Uncle; I've been making a <i>pesebre</i> for Elena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and it's finished now just in time. I would like
to go and set it up."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fine, Uncle. I've got twenty-eight
figures and the paint is dry on every one of them.
I worked all day yesterday in the back <i>patio</i>,
and Jos√©, the <i>portero</i>, helped me cut out the
camels. He said mine looked like giraffes."
And the boy began to lay them out on the
desk, tenderly lifting each one as though they
were alive and breathing.</p>

<p>As each little representation took its place
in the long row the Colonel's face grew tender.
He dared not smile at their crudity for behind
the rough, unskilful carving, he saw the ideal
that had been in the carver's mind. He was
seeing some new thing each day in the little
fellow's character that made him love him more;
and when they were all placed formally together,
he drew the little linen coated figure
into the circle of his arm and together they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
discussed the merits of each wee wooden
figure.</p>

<p>"Ni√±o, we will go together! That's what
we'll do," he exclaimed almost boyishly. "I
am tired of these long army statistics, so let us
go <i>inmediatamente</i>."</p>

<p>A span of Argentine thoroughbreds took them
this time, for the Colonel was a genuine lover of
horse flesh, and he owned several of the finest in
the country. It is said that an Argentine will
lavish as much care on his favourite horse as a
mother will upon her child; and these two, Saturnino
and Val-d'Or, were the pride of his heart.</p>

<p>"This pair, Francisco," he began, as they
took their seats in the open victoria, and the
silver studded harness tinkled as the splendid
horses started off; "this pair are to be taken
abroad next month with my two trotters, Benita
and Malacaro. Our horses are attracting more
and more attention in Europe as they see the
fine specimens our stables are sending there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall enter them on the English turf, and
I am ready to hazard their price that they will
come back, at least one of them, with a blue
riband. At any rate, I am sure there are no
finer appearing horses anywhere than these;
but all of our horses are good to look at. Of
course, I except those miserable cab horses;
they are a disgrace to their name, and should
be called sheep."</p>

<p>Thus he chatted on, full of his subject, until
they reached Francisco's home. They found
Guillerma and her mother away. They had
gone to celebrate mass and Elena, with the
one <i>servienta</i>, was alone in the house.</p>

<p>"You entertain her, Uncle Juan, while I
erect the <i>pesebre</i>," whispered Francisco.</p>

<p>So the gray haired soldier took Elena on his
knee and told her the story of a little girl who
was lost in a forest and of the convention of
animals that met to discuss her fate. He put
most eloquent speeches into the jaws and beaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the different birds and animals, such as the
deer, the puma, the ostrich, the jaguar, and
many others. Elena's eyes were wide as the
big bear growled out his belief that she should
be cut up into half <i>kilo</i> bits, and divided among
them; but just then Francisco entered the
room and asked them to come into the dining-room
where Estrella, the servant, was preparing
<i>m√°te</i>.</p>

<p>As they entered the <i>comedor</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Elena spied the
manger with its surrounding images in the
corner, on the floor.</p>

<p>"<i>Que hermosa! Que linda!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> she cried,
clasping her hands in ecstasy. "Only yesterday
did I tell Encarnaci√≥n, when she came to
bring me Christmas cakes full of almonds and
raisins, that we should have no <i>pesebre</i>. She
is to have one of ivory that cost a small fortune,
but I had rather have this. Oh! it is so beautiful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Who could have brought it? Who could
have put it here?" and she looked up inquiringly,
first at her uncle and then at her brother.
Uncle Juan's face pleaded "not guilty" but
Francisco's was so beamingly tell-tale that she
flew to him and embraced him and kissed him
over and over again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i085.jpg" width="334" height="500" alt="Girl plyaing with creche" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH GLORIOUS BLUE EYES!&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When each figure had been carefully inspected
and discussed Uncle Juan proposed
a ride, this time behind his favourite horses.
As they entered the house on their return he
was pleased to see a faint colour on Elena's
face and a brighter look in her eyes.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed, swiftly enough; New
Year's with its fireworks and noisy crowds of
celebrating <i>peons</i>, and at last came twelfth
night.</p>

<p>Elena awoke on the sixth of January feverishly
expectant. Surely, after having set up
such a lovely <i>pesebre</i>, the Three Kings would not
forget her. An excursion into the dining-room
proved their faithfulness, for there they stood&mdash;three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
smartly covered camels, and three wee
kings, bowing before the tiny babe in the
manger.</p>

<p>Around the room were the gifts they had
brought to her. A toy piano, a wonderful French
doll with a trunk full of clothes, a few picture-books
and a china tea set. She was still admiring
them when Francisco arrived; he was dressed
for travelling and was quite excited, but Elena
could not notice that, so absorbed was she in
her toys and doll.</p>

<p>"See this <i>mu√±eca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Francisco, mio! Did you
<i>ever</i> see such glorious blue eyes, just like the
English Se√±ora's on the corner. Why, you act
as though you had seen them before, Francisco,
are you not surprised to see so many?"
exclaimed Elena, impatient that he would not
kneel with her among her gifts.</p>

<p>"They are beautiful, Elena, every one of
them. But I am in a great haste for Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Juan and I are leaving from the Retiro Station
in half an hour. The servant, Jos√©, has taken
our trunks and large bags ahead, and I stopped
here to bid you all goodbye, as Uncle Juan
had another errand to do on his way down.
We go a day earlier than we had planned in
order that we may stop over for a day and night
in Rosario. I am glad, Elena, that your gifts
are so lovely, and if I were not in such a hurry,
we would have a long play together. But I
shall write to you, all of you;" and he embraced
them, each one, mother and two sisters, hastily,
not trusting himself to prolong the goodbye.</p>

<p>The Estaci√≥n Retiro was full of a holiday
crowd, for it was early morning. Jos√© was
awaiting him, and they stood watching the long
trains of cars coming and going, discharging
their loads into the long sheds, and swallowing
up another one and puffing out again. Francisco's
knowledge of railroads was limited. He
had never taken a long journey on one; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mother and Guillerma had taken him with
them on one of their yearly pilgrimages to the
shrine of Our Lady of Lujan, some forty miles
distant, for being devout Catholics, this was
never omitted. He began to grow nervous,
fearing his uncle would be too late, as the train
for Rosario was puffing and blowing just outside
the iron gate and the guard was preparing
to ring a huge bell, which announced the departure
of all trains. Just before its first peal
broke from its brass throat his uncle strode in,
and, motioning the servant to follow with the
bags, he hurried Francisco through the gate.</p>

<p>Jos√©, the <i>portero</i> accompanying them, was an
Araucanian Indian by birth, but he spoke
Spanish fluently. When a mere boy, the
Colonel's father had brought him from Chile,
when returning from a military expedition
into that country; and he had been a faithful
servant of the family ever since. As slavery is
prohibited in Argentina he had been paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wages since he became of age, over forty years
ago, but no power on earth could have induced
Jos√© to leave the service of Colonel Lacevera.</p>

<p>He was but slightly bent and possessed the
broad face and high cheek bones of the South
American Indian. His skin was like parchment,
and his eyes slanted peculiarly like the eyes of
the Chinese. When Francisco had spoken
of that last characteristic to his uncle he had
been told that many people believed these
Indians to be a tangent of the Oriental races,
and upheld their theory mainly because of the
peculiar similarity of the eyes.</p>

<p>Jos√© and Francisco were great friends and
Francisco was much pleased that Jos√© was to
be with them at the <i>estancia</i>, since his knowledge
of animals, birds, herbs, in fact all out door life,
was unlimited.</p>

<p>The car they occupied was a compartment
car of the English type, although the ponderous
engine was North American. As the railroads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of Argentina are mainly under English control
the English railway customs and equipments
are largely in evidence.</p>

<p>The pretty stations at each suburb are surrounded
by grass plots with beds of flowers,
and the English system of overhead bridges
across the tracks at all stations reduces the
number of accidents.</p>

<p>Francisco found out all of this by a series of
continuous questions as their train sped through
the pretty suburbs with their numbers of
summer homes, surrounded by well kept gardens.
The villages began to grow fewer and
fewer and Colonel Lacevera said:</p>

<p>"Now it's my turn, Ni√±o! Can you bound
the Argentine Republic?"</p>

<p>Francisco began in the sing-song manner of
the Spanish schools:&mdash;"On the north by
Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, on the west
and south by Chile; on the east by Brazil,
Uruguay and the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
one million, one hundred and eighteen thousand
square miles and its population is over
six million. It is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There! There!" exclaimed his uncle,
laughingly. "You may stop. No telling how
long you could sing the praises of your native
land. I want to tell you a few things that you
may not have learned. Do you know what
alluvial soil is?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like some metal," ventured the
boy.</p>

<p>"But it isn't. You see, Argentina was once
part of the ocean bed; for under the soil, way
back in the interior of the country, I, myself,
have found shells and gravel. This long level
stretch of land between the Atlantic Ocean
and the foothills of the Andes, that was once
covered with water, is now called the Pampas;
and you are now in that region.</p>

<p>"See that long, coarse grass stretching as far
as the eye can reach; it is the finest pasture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
land in the world and explains why we produce
such quantities of cattle, sheep and horses.
You see, having this excellent pasture-land,
so well watered, and a climate that insures
grazing the whole year through, our expenses
for raising and rearing cattle are very low. We
are a larger country than we appear on the
map, my boy. Why! we are twelve times as
large as Great Britain."</p>

<p>"Uncle, as we have so many things that are
the largest and best in the world, tell me, is
this the longest railroad on the earth?"</p>

<p>"No, Ni√±o, not quite that. Our railroads
are developing our country at a rapid rate and
we have some of the finest road beds in the
world, but that is because our country is so
level. Now that I think of it, we have got something
connected with railroads that is interesting.
We have the longest straight stretch of railway
in the world, it is said. On the Argentine
Pacific Railway from Buenos Aires to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Andes it runs like a surveyor's line two hundred
and eleven miles without deviating a foot. But
come, let us go into the dining car for breakfast;
it is already half-past eleven."</p>

<p>This was Francisco's greatest surprise of all
in a long list of the day's surprises. To eat in
a railway car, speeding fifty miles an hour,
with delicate china and napery, shining silver
and food like he had been having daily at his
uncle's table, seemed too wonderful to be
true.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NEW EXPERIENCES</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Levantese!</span> Levantese!" came Jos√©'s
voice to Francisco's ear, just as the latter was
lassoing a llama he had been pursuing on the
back of an ostrich.</p>

<p>Francisco rubbed his eyes and woke from his
dream to a babel of voices, and the train was
not in motion. Where could he be?</p>

<p>As he rubbed his sleepy eyes again his uncle
took him gently by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wake yourself, Ni√±o. We are in Rosario;
come, follow me."</p>

<p>Francisco followed him through the long hall
of the compartment car out into the big station
where insistent porters and shouting cab-men
made frantic grabs at them and their baggage,
only to be beaten off by Jos√©, whose language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as he scolded and berated them was not what
is known as "polite Spanish."</p>

<p>Selecting a victoria from the long line of
waiting ones, they entered, Jos√© sitting with
the driver, and were soon before the lighted
portals of a large hotel.</p>

<p>The building was two stories in height and
perfectly square; the second story bed-rooms
all opened on to a porch or corridor, which ran
completely around and overlooked the central
court on the first floor. The entrance was very
imposing with marble staircases and marble
pillars; and Francisco's sleepy eyes opened
wide in astonishment. They were just in time
for dinner; already the marble tables in the
<i>patio</i> were filling with men and women sipping
their afterdinner coffee in the cool open air.</p>

<p>As this was Francisco's first dinner in a hotel
it might be interesting to know what he ate.
Being an Argentine, he always ate several different
kinds of meat, and began this meal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a platter of cold meats: tongue, pressed chicken
and jellied veal. Second, a vermicelli soup
with grated cheese; third, fried <i>pejerey</i>, the
most popular fish of the country; fourth,
partridge fried in oil; fifth, asparagus with
melted butter; sixth, macaroni with tomato and
garlic sauce; seventh, roast mutton; eighth, a
salad of lettuce and tomatoes; ninth, a sweet
jelly in wine sauce; tenth, fruits; and then they
adjourned to the <i>patio</i> for coffee.</p>

<p>While his uncle smoked and talked with
friends, whom he had chanced to meet, Francisco
slipped away and Jos√© helped him undress
for bed, as he was very tired.</p>

<p>He remembered no more after Jos√© turned
off the electric light until he opened his eyes
into the full glare of the sun, the next morning.
It was nine o'clock and Jos√© was laying out
clean linen for him. After a refreshing shower
bath, he returned to his room to find his rolls
and coffee on a table beside his bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Jos√©, I'm not a lady that I must have
my <i>caf√©</i> in bed!" exclaimed the lad. "Mother
and the girls always do that, but I'm a man
and I want to have mine in the dining-room
with Uncle Juan."</p>

<p>Jos√© explained that in hotels one must always
take one's morning coffee in one's rooms; and
he talked on while Francisco ate and dressed.</p>

<p>"<i>El Coronel</i> will be busy all of the day and
he has placed you in my hands. Rosario, I
know like a book, and together we will see it."</p>

<p>"Oh! that will be great fun, Jos√©. Where
shall we go first?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to see them load the vessels?
This city is where much of the wheat of our
country is brought to be loaded into the vessels
for Europe. The river is so deep here that the
largest ocean-going vessels can come up to the
docks."</p>

<p>They walked through crowded, busy streets
until they came to a high bluff, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
edge of this they could look down on the very
tops of the long rows of steamships below, all
being loaded with wheat.</p>

<p>This was just the beginning of the busy
season, for the harvest was scarcely under way.
In January and February the whole city of
Rosario would seem nothing but wheat, wheat,
wheat.</p>

<p>Francisco saw all of this with deepest interest;
he was beginning to comprehend the
resources of his own country.</p>

<p>They sat watching the course of the wheat
bags as they shot down the long chutes from
the high bluffs to the vessels below, until
Francisco's eyes grew tired and even when he
closed them he could see long lines of bobbing
bags, like yellow mice, chasing one another
into the water.</p>

<p>So they walked along the bluff, counting the
flags of the different nations displayed on the
boats beneath them; English, French, Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Dutch, German and a few that Francisco had
never seen before.</p>

<p>For a while they watched the <i>lavaderas</i> or
washer-women pounding the clothes of the
city on the rocks at the edge of the water; and
spreading them on the higher rocks behind them
to bleach and dry.</p>

<p>Steam laundries are uncommon in South
America and all of the washing is done in this
manner. The <i>lavaderas</i> carry the soiled linen
from the houses to the river on their heads,
balancing huge bundles as easily as though they
were trifles, their arms folded across their
breasts.</p>

<p>As they stood watching this cleansing process
Francisco spied a raft-like boat piled high with
small logs tied on securely.</p>

<p>"It looks out of place here, Jos√©, among all
these enormous freight steamers. What does
it carry?"</p>

<p>"Willow, Se√±orito, and see, there are others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
coming down the river. It goes to Buenos Aires
to be made into charcoal, the principal fuel of
that city. Great quantities of it are raised
above here; it is quick of growth and needs
only to be planted so," and Jos√© demonstrated
by taking a short twig and sticking it into the
earth.</p>

<p>"Behold! and in seven years, it is as you
see it there on the rafts ready for market.
They use the twigs for making Osier baskets.
But <i>hace calor</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> let us go to the cool shady
<i>patio</i> of the hotel and there I will tell you a
story of some charcoal burners until the Uncle
comes."</p>

<p>But the Colonel reached the hotel before
they did, for Francisco must stop to see this
thing and that as they sauntered along. The
mid-day heat meant little to him while so
much of novelty challenged his attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Jos√© was always ready to answer his questions,
and he frequently drew the boy's notice to
something that would escape any one but a
keen observer, and this the Indian was.</p>

<p>The sun was almost in midheaven, and the
daily <i>siesta</i> was beginning in some parts of the
city. Workshops were being closed, and under
every tree some cart driver had drawn up his
horse and stretched himself on the grass under
its shade; even the beggars were curled up on
the church steps fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Why do some of those ragged beggars wear
metal badges, Jos√©?"</p>

<p>"They are licensed beggars, Se√±orito. The
city has authorized them to beg, and when you
help them you may know you are helping no
rogues."</p>

<p>Francisco drew his nose up into a prolonged
sniff. "I believe I'm hungry, Jos√©. What
smells so good?"</p>

<p>"Step here on to this side street and I'll
show you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The street was being torn up to be repaved,
and the <i>peon</i> workingmen at this noon interval
of rest were eating their <i>almuerzo</i>. Gathered
in little groups, they sat around something that
was cooking and emitting odours of stewing
meat, potatoes and onions.</p>

<p>"But how are they cooking here in the
street?"</p>

<p>"Go closer and you can see," replied Jos√©.</p>

<p>Francisco walked to the curb, and looking
over their backs into the middle of one circle
he saw&mdash;the stew cooking in a shovel.</p>

<p>"They buy these things at the market and
use their street shovels for stewpans, as you
see."</p>

<p>"Ugh! I hope they wash them first," laughed
Francisco.</p>

<p>They were now passing the market, an
enormous affair covering the best of a large
block. But the scene was no longer animated
for the chattering and bargaining were beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to cease; and the merchants, themselves,
were nodding over their wares.</p>

<p>Along the curbing were piles of merchandise;
here, a stack of peaches, pears, apricots, figs,
nectarines, grapes, and plums; there, an array
of earthen ware, in curious shapes; here, a
stock of readymade clothing, aprons, trousers,
<i>ponchos</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and shoes. The vegetables were
heaped high in piles; tomatoes, beans, lettuce,
cardon, celery, potatoes, cucumbers, and onions
in long ropes, their stems so plaited together
with straw that they can be sold by the yard;
or, in that country's measure, a <i>metro</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Many of the stalls offered cooked foods;
roasted partridges and chickens; p√¢tes of
jellied meats; cleaned and cooked armadillo,
whose meat tastes like tender roast pork. The
Argentines are very fond of them and they
consume thousands every month.</p>

<p>Around the curbing, at one end of the market,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
stood great carts, with wheels fully eight feet
high. These, Jos√© told Francisco, were the
market carts that brought the produce into the
city. They look rude and cumbersome, but
carry several tons and often as many as a
dozen oxen are hitched to them.</p>

<p>These interested Francisco but Jos√© bid
him hurry as no doubt his uncle would have
breakfasted. Which, indeed, he was doing, for
as they entered the hotel Francisco caught sight
of him, seated in the long dining-room with
several gentlemen; all of them, including the
Colonel, in cool looking white linen suits.
Francisco joined them and was introduced to
the strangers.</p>

<p>They were wealthy <i>estancieros</i> but not Spaniards.
One was an Englishman and the other
a North American, owning ranches near Rosario,
and they were negotiating with Colonel
Lacevera for some pedigreed horses which he
owned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>They talked partly in Spanish and partly in
English; for like most educated Argentines, the
Colonel spoke some English and understood
more. Francisco had studied English at school
just as he did French, and he was delighted to be
able to understand some of their conversation.</p>

<p>Before they parted, the Englishman urged
Colonel Lacevera to attend a large sale of cattle
and horses which was to take place at his
<i>estancia</i> the next day, Sunday. Patting Francisco
on the head he added:</p>

<p>"Bring the Ni√±o also, he may enjoy it."</p>

<p>So early the following morning Jos√© had their
horses at the curb of the hotel, saddled and
ready for the three league gallop.</p>

<p>Francisco had not ridden often, but his
enthusiasm knew no bounds when he saw the
Argentine pony that was to be his mount.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked at Jos√© meaningly, for
he knew that this eagerness would not outlast
the long gallop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>At first they rode briskly in the cool morning
air. Francisco held on bravely, but the Colonel
noticed the firm set of his lips, and that he talked
less and less as they rode on.</p>

<p>They were riding through beautiful country.
The turf was fresh and green in spots where
the old coarse grass had been burned off and
the tender young sprouts were coming up
through the rich soil. They passed droves of
several thousand sheep nibbling peacefully on
this succulent new growth. There were shepherds,
with here and there a hut made of poles
covered with mud; the roof thatched with
asparta grass.</p>

<p>Francisco was so tired and his bones began
to ache so desperately that he ceased to show
any interest in the things they passed. Colonel
Lacevera and Jos√© exchanged knowing looks,
but dared not permit Francisco to see them.
When they came to one of these rude huts his
uncle said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ni√±o, would you not like to see the inside
of one of these <i>prairie palaces?</i>"</p>

<p>He admired the boy's pluck, but he feared
to tax his physical endurance more.</p>

<p>Francisco willingly assented, and they rode
up to the door around which a swarm of dirty,
half naked children sat on the ground.</p>

<p>Jos√© called: "Ola!" and a copper-coloured
woman appeared at the door, dressed only in
one garment, a dun-coloured chemise.</p>

<p>She was an Indian, and when Jos√© spoke to
her in her own tongue, asking for a drink, she
pointed to the square kerosene tin filled with
water, beside which hung a gourd.</p>

<p>She said her husband was out with the sheep;
and she had no chairs to offer them, but they
might alight and rest.</p>

<p>They stepped into the hut, the door of which
was a horse's hide; the floor was the hard
earth; a box stood in the middle and served as
a table, while bundles of straw in the corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
served as beds. Instead of chairs there were
dried skulls of oxen; their wide, spreading
horns serving as arms to these unique seats.
Francisco was glad, however, to rest his weary
body within their grewsome embrace and he
sat thus for half an hour, while Jos√© watered
the horses and the Colonel talked to the children.</p>

<p>Francisco himself proposed that they start
on, but Jos√© was obliged to lift him into his
saddle. One more league and they were in
sight of the <i>estancia</i>, where the sale was to be
held.</p>

<p>The house was of the usual Spanish style of
architecture, and the many buildings grouped
around it gave the place a resemblance to a
village.</p>

<p>Se√±or Stanley met them and "gave" them
his house, after the manner of all Spanish hosts,
and they entered to wash and rest.</p>

<p>As the Se√±or Stanley was an Englishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his house interested Francisco in spite of his
weariness. It was fitted with every luxury of
a high class English home; the baths being
supplied with cool spring water which flowed
through them constantly. There were handsomely
furnished parlours, a well-filled library
and a billiard room. The stables were commodious
and sanitary; and the tennis courts
and golf links, gardens and <i>patios</i> were numerous.</p>

<p>In the corrals they found several hundred
men gathered and there was much confusion
and noise.</p>

<p>It was Sunday and therefore a holiday spirit
pervaded everything, for Sunday is not observed
in Argentina as a day of quiet and
reverence; it is the day for sports, games and
excursions. This sale had been set for Sunday
to insure a large attendance.</p>

<p>First, breakfast was served. Under a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
arbour, formed by tall eucalyptus trees, the
table, fully a hundred feet in length, had been
set. At each place was a bunch of flowers and
a bottle of native wine.</p>

<p>Despite his aching body, Francisco did full
justice to the soup, barbecued meats and fowls,
vegetables and fruits that were served. But
after he had eaten he crept under the shade of
one of the trees to rest.</p>

<p>He fell asleep and slept until his uncle
wakened him at <i>m√°te</i> time.</p>

<p>"Hello, my boy! Slept through all of this
noise? You were certainly exhausted, for such
a clatter as there has been. One hundred
thousand dollars and many pedigreed animals
have changed hands, and it wasn't done quietly
either. We will have our <i>m√°te</i> and then ride
home in the cool of the evening. Come."
And the Colonel helped the stiff jointed, weary
boy to his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE RANCH</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> is that you have, Manuel?" cried
Francisco, to one of the <i>peons</i>, five days later,
as he sat under an omb√∫ tree in the garden on
his uncle's <i>estancia</i>, playing with some tame
<i>tierra</i> birds, that kept the garden clean of
worms.</p>

<p>Manuel was one of the house <i>peons</i> and he
had a queer looking machine with a long snout
under his arm.</p>

<p>"Why, this is an ant destroyer, Se√±orito;
would you care to watch me kill ants?"</p>

<p>For answer, Francisco ran eagerly to his side
and the two walked toward the peach orchard.
Francisco had had five days of rest from his
tiresome ride the day of the sale, and he was
now ready for any new adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>They had arrived at the Tres Arroyas ranch
three days before and he had made friends with
every one connected with the house and gardens.
The heat had been too great to allow
of any wider acquaintance, which would have
included the gauchos, or cowboys; at least the
nearer ones, for the Tres Arroyas ranch was
very large, and Francisco never could have
known them all. Jos√© had told him that one
could ride all day from the centre and not reach
its boundaries.</p>

<p>"Why do you use that to kill ants?" he
asked of Manuel. "Our <i>servienta</i> at home uses
hot water when they get into the <i>patio</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Se√±orito, but these country ants
come in such armies it would take a geyser of
boiling water to kill them. Now, we are here
in the orchard; you can see how they destroy
things."</p>

<p>Curious rivulets of tawny brown ran here and
there as far as the eye could reach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Last spring these ants fairly cleaned our
peach trees of their tender young leaves, and it
was only by continuous labour that we exterminated
them. Now, look at them! Thick as
ever."</p>

<p>"But how can you kill millions of ants with
so small a machine?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't this afternoon. I brought the
machine here to place it and get it ready; then
early in the morning I will tap on the iron
bars of your window and you must follow
me."</p>

<p>It was scarcely more than dawn the next
morning when Francisco heard the gentle
tapping on the <i>rejas</i> at his window. He had
forgotten his engagement with Manuel, and
started up in bewilderment. The sight of the
<i>peon</i> reminded him and he hurried into his
garments and was soon with Manuel in the
crisp morning air.</p>

<p>"A little more of the sun above the horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and we would have been too late for to-day,"
said the swarthy Spaniard, as he busied himself
lighting the machine.</p>

<p>"Ants are early risers, and it's only by
getting up before they have made their morning
toilets that we can manage to make war on
them."</p>

<p>Francisco laughed at the idea of an ant
bathing and dressing, and bent over on his
knees beside Manuel who was scratching a
match to light the dry rubbish in the cylindrical
can, in one end of which was a small amount of
sulphur. He screwed a lid on the other end,
inserted the snout into an ant hole and with a
pair of bellows he sent the volumes of sulphurous
smoke into the labyrinthine passages
of the ant houses.</p>

<p>"Look, look," excitedly cried Francisco,
as quantities of smoke were seen issuing from
many holes, here and there, within a radius
of several hundred yards; showing how intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and many winding are the underground passages
of these industrious pests.</p>

<p>"Yes, there won't be many ants getting out
to work this morning. But in a short while they
will be just as bad as ever."</p>

<p>They went from one part of the orchard to
another until the sun was too high, and they
were obliged to stop until another morning.
Francisco learned, as they walked toward the
house, that these ants are the worst pest, excepting
the locust, that the farmer has to
combat. They particularly delight in carrying
away whole beds of strawberries and they often
come in armies that swarm over every obstacle
in their path.</p>

<p>As they entered the house, Francisco noticed
that his uncle had had <i>caf√©</i> and was in his
riding breeches ready for a morning gallop.</p>

<p>"May I go with you, Uncle Juan?" cried
Francisco.</p>

<p>"Hey! That's spirit for you! Rode yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to fragments a few days ago and ready for
another trial to-day. <i>Che</i>," clapping his hands
as a <i>peon</i> appeared.</p>

<p>"Saddle Barboza for the Se√±orito, <i>inmediatamente</i>."</p>

<p>Francisco gulped his <i>caf√©</i> and nibbled at a
biscuit, but he was too excited to eat more.</p>

<p>When the horses were brought to the door,
his eyes gleamed, for he saw that the smaller
horse, that was to be his to ride while he was
on the <i>estancia</i>, was resplendent in a new saddle,
bridle and bit. The servant brought a set of
solid silver spurs and smart leather riding boots
which he assisted Francisco to put on, and which
he told him his uncle had had sent with the
saddle and outfit from the city.</p>

<p>The stirrups were of silver, beautifully chased,
and the head stall, ornaments for the brow band
which covers most of the horse's face, and the
<i>pretel</i> bangles that jingled across the horse's
breast, were all of the same valuable metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It was indeed the outfit of a gentleman, and on
Barboza, the sleek bay horse, with the neat,
light hoof of the prairie steed, it seemed an
equipment fit for a prince. His uncle appeared
at the mounting block and Francisco kissed
him again and again as he thanked him for
the lovely gifts.</p>

<p>"Hey! Hey! We can't waste time thus, my
boy. I am going over to the west of the <i>estancia</i>
to inspect some horse branding that is to take
place to-day. The <i>mayor domo</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> will follow me
later."</p>

<p>They cantered off across the corral and were
soon on the open plains. On and on, over the
pastures, some of them red, like battle grounds
with the scarlet <i>margarita</i> or verbena; when
again they would reach a huge patch of white
ones that looked at a distance like snow.</p>

<p>"What was that, Uncle?" exclaimed Francisco,
startled, as a large bird with yellow breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and gray wings screeched across their path,
emitting a harsh cry of several syllables.</p>

<p>"That is the <i>bicho-feo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"Why do they call it ugly bug? It is a bird."</p>

<p>"Because its cry is not unlike those words.
Listen again and you will hear how plainly he
says it. It is a bird of prey and lives on smaller
birds. That bird just fluttering up out of the
grass at your left is a scissors bird."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know why. See how its two long
tail feathers clip the air like scissors as it flies."</p>

<p>They passed numbers of small gray owls;
and once Francisco spied a flock of flamingoes
across the water of a small lake. Occasionally
they passed a shepherd's hut; but now they
were getting on beyond the sheep grazing
pastures and great herds of cattle came in
sight.</p>

<p>Francisco leaped in his saddle with joy.
"Oh! Uncle, are we coming to the cowboys?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>His boyish enthusiasm had pictured them
on their native heath so often, and now he was
really to see them! He had watched them when
they came to the city on holidays and walked
along the Paseo de Julio, where the pawn
shops, with their tempting offers of silver
sheathed knives, gaily striped <i>ponchos</i>, and
silver mounted <i>rebenques</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> draw them as honey
draws bees; but to see them on the plains,&mdash;that
was what he wanted!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Group of coyboys" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SOON AFTER HIS EAGER QUESTION THEY PASSED A GROUP
OF THEM.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He did not have to call on his reserve of
patience; indeed, soon after his eager question
they passed a group of them, crouched on the
ground around a fire of dry thistles, over which
hung a can, suspended by wire from a tripod,
and which held the water for their morning
<i>m√°te</i>. They arose to their feet as the Colonel
galloped past and greeted him with <i>vivas</i>.</p>

<p>"Do they often use those murderous looking
knives on each other, Uncle?" asked Francisco;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the sight of their weapons having subdued
his zeal somewhat. They were rougher
looking men in their working clothes than
when they came to the city dressed for a lark.</p>

<p>"Seldom, Ni√±o; unless they are intoxicated.
They are not very civilized and they have no
education whatever. They fairly live on their
horses' backs and cannot be persuaded to do
any work that must be done outside their
saddles."</p>

<p>They were, indeed, fierce in appearance.
Their knee-high boots were made of rawhide;
they wore no trousers, but a striped blanket
held around the waist with a belt, then brought
between the legs and fastened again to the
belt in front, formed the covering of the lower
part of the body. This is called the <i>chirapa</i>
and when walking it gives the wearer a bulky
appearance, not unlike a Turk.</p>

<p>As these were <i>peon gauchos</i>, or low-class
cowboys, they were not so picturesque as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gentleman <i>gaucho</i>, who is entirely different in
appearance and character.</p>

<p>The <i>mayor domo</i> rode up to them within the
first hour, and his costume was that of the
<i>caballero</i> class or gentleman <i>gaucho</i>.</p>

<p>He also wore the <i>chirapa</i>, but it was over long
white cotton trousers, the edges of which were
embroidered and finished with hand-made lace.
Instead of the rawhide belt of the <i>peon gaucho</i>,
his was a strip of hogskin doubled, the inside
forming a pocket, which was stitched into
compartments, these being made secure with
clasps made of silver coins; from all of this
hung a festoon of coins encircling the entire
waist. The large clasp in the front was of
solid silver, carved to represent the crest of
Argentina. Several knives were thrust through
his elaborate belt, and his riding whip was of
closely braided rawhide, with a heavy silver
handle.</p>

<p>Francisco eyed him curiously, but with evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
admiration. This was more to his liking,
and he rode between this gentleman of the
Pampas and his soldier uncle with great pride.
Almost, he was persuaded to be a <i>gaucho</i>,
but a side glance at his idolized uncle brought
quick repentance to his heart.</p>

<p>How could he be so disloyal to his family
traditions! A <i>soldado</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of course, that was his
destiny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CATTLE BRANDING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> reached the western corral about ten
o'clock, and found the branding already under
way. Several dozen <i>peon gauchos</i> had assembled
and they had driven the horses to
be branded into an enclosure.</p>

<p>"See, Ni√±o, these are all young animals;
they have never had the iron on them."</p>

<p>"Why do you brand them, Uncle Juan?
Your <i>estancia</i> is so large surely they could not
stray on to a neighbour's ranch; and then the
<i>gauchos</i> watch them carefully?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are so many thousands that,
despite the best of care, our horses stray away
occasionally. Before every yearly round-up,
we send <i>peons</i> to all the neighbouring ranches
to gather in the strayed ones; and if our brand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is on them there is never any question as to
their owner. I am gradually having the outskirts
of the <i>estancia</i> enclosed in barbed wire
fencing, but it is so many leagues around that
it is no easy matter. But look, see how they
catch them!"</p>

<p>They were using the <i>bolas</i>, and although
Francisco had often seen them in the shop
windows, he had never seen them in use. They
are an aboriginal device for lassoing cattle and
horses. They consist each of three stone
balls covered with leather and all attached
to long thongs, two of which are longer than
the third. The ends of these thongs are attached
together and when the <i>gaucho</i> uses them
he raises his hand holding these ends above
his head and whirls them around and around
to gather momentum, then opening his hand
the weapon flies away to coil itself about the
feet of the animal that he wishes to lasso.
These <i>gauchos</i> are so skilful in the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<i>bolas</i> that their aim is unerring, and although it
sometimes bruises the captive's legs, it is a most
convenient method for catching a fleet-footed
horse or cow.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i129.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="branding" />
<span class="caption">&quot;BLAZED THE LINES OF THE TRES ARROYAS ON ITS HIP&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When the <i>gaucho</i> in the enclosure had caught
a horse by this means, he immediately pulled
it to the ground. A <i>peon</i> sat on its neck while
another held it by a rope around its fore-legs,
and a third blazed the lines of the Tres Arroyas
brand on its hip. The mark was in the
shape of a horseshoe, inside of which was a
cross; and at least ten of these groups were
busy all of the time, burning it on the young
animals.</p>

<p>"What do you raise these wild horses for,
Uncle Juan?" inquired Francisco, who had
not missed one single detail of the performance.
"They are not fine horses like Barboza here,"
and he patted his steed's neck affectionately.</p>

<p>"No, they are not, by any means. These
wild horses are raised for their hides mainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
although very little of them goes to waste when
they are skinned. Look over yonder, near that
cluster of mud huts, where the hides are drying
in the air and sun."</p>

<p>Francisco's eyes followed the end of the silver
riding whip that his uncle used to point with,
and saw tier after tier of poles, from which
were stretched horsehides to stakes in the
ground below.</p>

<p>Turning to Don Carlos, the <i>mayor domo</i>,
who was near-by, the Colonel inquired the
worth of the horses being branded.</p>

<p>"Not less than ten or twelve dollars each,"
answered the superintendent. "These are
very good ones. Does the Se√±or care to have
his breakfast now?"</p>

<p>For some time, Francisco had been feeling
pangs of hunger. His hurried <i>caf√©</i> had not
been sufficient nourishment for the long hot
ride, and now his hunger was aroused by odours
that came to his nostrils like pleasant messengers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
yet, he could not see anything cooking.</p>

<p>"Uncle, shall we eat out here with the
<i>gauchos?</i>" he asked, wild-eyed.</p>

<p>"Very near them anyhow, but not exactly
<i>with</i> them. Manuel came ahead of us to
prepare our <i>almuerzo</i>, which is in process of
cooking over yonder behind that clump of
willows. Before we eat you shall see the
<i>gauchos</i> eat, but I warn you it is not a prepossessing
sight.</p>

<p>"Here, Don Carlos, have the men go to
their breakfast now, the lad wants to see
their table manners."</p>

<p>Don Carlos rode into the corral, spoke a
few words and the branding ceased. Each
man mounted his own pony, for an Argentine
cowboy never walks, be his journey ever so
short. With cheers and shouts they galloped
toward the mud huts near-by.</p>

<p>Francisco and the Colonel followed at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
more dignified pace. They found the men
gathered about in groups, squatting on the
ground or sitting on ox skulls.</p>

<p>The beef had been quartered and roasted
on a spit over a charcoal fire, outside one of
the huts. Each man, without ceremony, had
"fallen to" and helped himself, by cutting
great chunks of the meat from the large piece on
the fire.</p>

<p>Holding one end with his teeth and the other
with his hand, each man would sever the bite
about two inches from his mouth with one
of his silver-handled belt knives.</p>

<p>"You see how superfluous are knives, forks
and plates," said the Colonel in an undertone
to Francisco as they watched this primitive
process.</p>

<p>"And now for our own breakfast. I am as
hollow as is the wild pumpkin at the end of
summer," and he gave a sharp blow to his
horse, another to Barboza, and they were off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
towards their own waiting meal in the shadow
of the willows.</p>

<p>Manuel had killed a small kid soon after
reaching the corral, and had roasted it on a
spit in its skin over a fire of dry thistles and
charcoal. He was basting it with salt water,
which he had brought in a bottle. In the coals
below were sweet potatoes roasting in their
jackets. So tempting were the combined odours
of lamb and sweet potatoes that Francisco
ran to the little stream to wash himself, in
order that he might begin to appease his appetite
at once.</p>

<p>"I <i>never</i> was so hungry," said he, as he took
the tin plate offered him by Manuel. "I think
I could eat with my hands like the cowboys!
Do they ever eat anything but meat?"</p>

<p>"Seldom. They care but little for vegetables;
not enough to take the trouble of raising
a few. Meat and <i>galletas</i>, the hard biscuit of
the Pampas, often three or four months old, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
all they have besides their <i>m√°te</i>, that they
<i>must</i> have always.</p>

<p>"Que esperanza! lad, this lamb is good!
It takes me back to other days. Many times
on our expeditions into the provinces have I
eaten thus."</p>

<p>"Tell me, do tell me of one while we eat and
rest," coaxed Francisco.</p>

<p>"There were many, lad," said the Colonel,
as he passed his plate back to Manuel for
another piece of the smoking, savoury lamb.
"I've never told you of the expedition of
General Roca into Patagonia. I was commanding
a regiment at that time, one of the
regiments that became famous because of that
remarkable undertaking.</p>

<p>"Patagonia is all of the southern-most part
of this continent lying between the Rio<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Negro
and the Straits of Magellan, excepting the
narrow strip between the Andes and the Pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Ocean, which belongs to Chile. This country
is not the barren, unproductive country now
that it was before our expedition carried civilization
to its wild wastes and reclaimed those
vast prairies from the Indians."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Juan, what right had Argentina
to take the land from the Indians of Patagonia?
They had lived there for centuries
and it was theirs."</p>

<p>"It is a long story, Ni√±o, and I shall give
you only the bare outline. You see, Patagonia
is a series of vast terraces from the Atlantic
Ocean to the foot of the Andes. On
these well watered steppes, Patagonian Indians,
mainly the Chennas, raised their cattle, allowing
them to rove at will. But the winters there are
most severe, especially when a <i>pampero</i> blows;
so, during the winter months, they drove their
immense droves of cattle to the northward into
the foothills of the Andes, where it was warmer.
During these winter sojourns close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
frontier of our Republic, they lived by murdering
and stealing from our settlements, and
the development of our lands was being retarded
because these pioneers were obliged
to flee to the cities and leave their fields of
grain and maize, their vineyards and their
cattle to the mercy of the marauders.</p>

<p>"Gradually the outposts of our civilization
were creeping closer to Buenos Aires, instead
of extending and growing as they should. Do
you now see why we were justified in fighting
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I didn't know they had made any
trouble. I supposed they were peaceful."</p>

<p>"Far from it. At last when Don Nicolas
Avellaneda became President, he sent General
Roca, who was my general, and the Minister of
War, into Patagonia to exterminate these
Chennas.</p>

<p>"It was not an easy task, for these Indians
are a fierce race, giants in size and strength.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Do you know how they came by their name,
Patagonians?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard, it must have something
to do with their feet as 'patagon' means 'large
foot.'"</p>

<p>"That's it exactly. Magellan, the discoverer,
saw their footprints in the sand and because
of their magnitude, he believed them
to be giants, and called them that before he
had ever seen them.</p>

<p>"Well, General Roca never knew discouragement,
and he set about their defeat by
digging great trenches, twenty feet deep and
twenty feet wide, while the Indians were up
in the mountains with their herds of cattle.</p>

<p>"These trenches he covered with boughs,
over which earth was scattered, and when all
was ready he sent us back to drive the Chennas
toward the ditches.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible price to pay for their
cruelty, and I shudder now as I recall that
awful day; but nearly all civilization is bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with blood, and it certainly ran in torrents then.
The Indians, unsuspecting, fell headlong, thousands
of them, into the trenches, and the few
that were unhurt by the fall or by being crushed
in the trenches were made prisoners and distributed
among the victorious regiments as
servants or soldiers. The women and children
were captured and sent to the cities to work.</p>

<p>"Ah! But those ditches! The birds, foxes,
and armadillos must have grown fat on the
thousands of bodies we left on that plain."</p>

<p>Francisco begged for more, his eyes were
ablaze and his cheeks flushed, but the Colonel
said:</p>

<p>"No more of fighting, anyhow; but come
here by the stream, now that we have finished
our meal, and I will tell you of some of the
animals I saw in Patagonia."</p>

<p>"Did you ever chase ostriches?" eagerly
inquired the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, several times and it is great
sport; and once, for three days, I had only
ostrich eggs to eat. You see, we were digging
those same trenches and could not spare many
of the men for hunting. I was ill and could
not eat the army rations, so Jos√© brought me
ostrich eggs and cooked them as the Indians
do&mdash;in the red-hot coals."</p>

<p>"And was Jos√© with you on that expedition?"
exclaimed Francisco.</p>

<p>"Yes, through all my campaigns he has
been my body servant. It was Jos√© who told us
how the Indians catch ostriches; he had heard
it when a boy among his tribe of Araucanians."</p>

<p>Francisco clapped his hands in anticipation.</p>

<p>"A circle of fire around a great area was
built and the huntsmen remained within this
circle. The ostriches and guanacos that were
thus imprisoned in the circle of fire were easy
prey for they fear fire and ran almost into our
arms. Why, what's the matter, Ni√±o?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The interest had died out of Francisco's eyes
and he sat with his hands clasped over his
knees.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Juan, I'll tell you. I'm disappointed!"</p>

<p>"Disappointed! How?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Juan, I don't think that's fair play
or good sport."</p>

<p>"<i>Que esperanza!</i>" exclaimed his uncle, secretly
proud of the boy's loyalty to his conviction,
but determined to draw him out on the
subject.</p>

<p>"And who are you that you may sit in
judgment on generals and captains?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't think one's rank has anything
to do with one's opinions. Uncle, if a <i>peon</i>
thinks a thing is not right he must not do that
even though the President, himself, commands
him; and I don't think hunting animals in
that fashion is fair. The little English boy
I play with at school is always saying that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Spaniards are not&mdash;well, he calls it 'sporty.'
That's their English word for it. He says
that the Englishmen are the truest sports on
earth and that they would never hunt as we
do."</p>

<p>"To a certain extent he is right, Francisco.
We don't care for the excitement of the chase
merely for the excitement as they do; we are
less active in our temperament, and prefer
to gain our ends with the least expenditure
of energy. I want you, above all things, my
lad, to be broad-minded, and able to see your
own shortcomings, so think this matter out
and if you are convinced that we are not right
as a people, in our attitude towards sports,
or anything else for that matter, formulate
your own opinions and then stick to them.</p>

<p>"It is through such men that all nations
grow; and the men that are able to see their
national deficiencies are the great men, the
reformers, and the leaders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"But in regard to the ostriches. How would
you catch them if you had the opportunity?"</p>

<p>"I should do it as the English lad tells me
he saw them do it in Chubut Territory; that's
part of Patagonia, isn't it, Uncle?"</p>

<p>The Colonel nodded, smoking industriously.</p>

<p>"Well, he says the real way to catch ostriches
is with the <i>bolas</i>. He saw his father
chase them there and he says they hunt them
in an open plain, not in a circle of fire. They
give the birds an equal chance with them for
their lives, and if the ostrich can't outrun them,
then, when they are within throwing distance,
they whirl the <i>bolas</i> around their legs and trip
them. He says it is fun to see an ostrich run;
it stretches out its long neck and with its awkward
long legs kicks up a great cloud of dust
behind it. He also told me about seeing guanacos
and pumas. Did you ever hunt them,
Uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but guanacos are hard to shoot because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of their keen sense of smell, they can
scent a human being over a mile away; but
their flesh is delicious, tasting much like venison.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the puma skin in the
library of my city house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have often seen it and one day I
measured it; it was over two metros in length.
Are those guanaco skins in the dining-room
at the <i>estancia</i>&mdash;the tawny yellow ones with
white spots and such deep soft fur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the ostrich robe that your aunt
uses in her carriage is made of the breasts
of young ostriches; it is as soft as down and
marked brown and white. The Patagonian
Indian women often wear them for capes,
although they are very expensive.</p>

<p>"You know, the ostriches we have here are
not the kind that produce the long plumes
worn in ladies' hats; these are called the
'rhea' and are an allied species. Speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of skins, Francisco, I will tell you of one that
will interest you. It is a vicu√±a, and one of
the finest I have ever seen. It was presented
to your great-grandfather, General Lacevera,
by a chief of the Incas, as a vicu√±a robe is
worn only by one of royal blood among the
Indians. It saw service as your great-grandfather's
<i>poncho</i> during his remarkable career,
and is now over one hundred years old, yet
it is as soft as velvet. Being one of our family
heirlooms, it shall be yours, as I have no son."</p>

<p>"That pleases me and I shall be very proud
of it."</p>

<p>"As you well may be. Whatever fortunes
come to you in life, Ni√±o, remember you are a
Lacevera."</p>

<p>Sleep was sweet that night, and Francisco's
head was scarcely on his pillow when guanacos,
vicu√±as and even <i>gauchos</i> were forgotten in
dreamless slumber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SUCCESSFUL SEARCH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was not a dull moment for Francisco
during the weeks that followed. Don Carlos,
the superintendent, lived in the great house
the year through. He was a bachelor and a
man of education, so that when the Colonel
came each summer he insisted that he keep
his usual quarters; for the house was very
extensive and the Colonel enjoyed his company
at meals and during the long evenings.</p>

<p>Francisco had accompanied Don Carlos on
several excursions and once, with a <i>tropilla</i> of
horses (eight or ten riding horses driven loose
by a <i>peon</i> for fresh mounts on a long journey),
they had gone on a journey of five days to a
neighbouring <i>estancia</i> to purchase algarroba
posts for the extensive fencing that was taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
place on the Tres Arroyas ranch. This algarroba
wood is like iron and under water is almost
imperishable.</p>

<p>They had passed by one small <i>estancia</i> devoted
almost exclusively to peanut culture;
there were leagues and leagues of them being
raised to be shipped to the Mediterranean
ports to be made into <i>olive oil</i>. They had
their dinner at this <i>estancia</i> and Francisco
ate bread made from powdered peanuts mixed
with wheat flour and he found it very delicious.</p>

<p>Jos√© had taken him on several fishing excursions,
and once they had hunted <i>armadillos</i>
with small dogs. Francisco had laughed
heartily at the antics of one dog, who had almost
caught the horny-plated little animal when it
suddenly rolled up into a ball, its back of
movable, bony bands enveloping it like an
armour, and rolled off a bluff over the river
bank, falling fully fifty feet; while the puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
dog peeped cautiously over the brink to see
it unroll itself and with its short legs hastily
dig a retreat under the earth.</p>

<p>On Francisco's birthday his uncle had given
a <i>fiesta</i> in his honour. There were fireworks
and races, and cowboys from all parts of the
<i>estancia</i> came in their full cowboy regalia on
their best horses to participate. It was very
interesting, and then there was a dinner for
everybody and after that a dance. Francisco,
himself, presented the prizes, and his uncle
made a speech.</p>

<p>After so much excitement Francisco overslept
the next morning, and awoke to find that
his uncle had ridden to a far corner of the <i>estancia</i>
to inspect some of the new fencing; he had
left word that he would not return until late
that night.</p>

<p>Francisco sat under his favourite omb√∫ tree,
watching a <i>mangang√°</i>, or carpenter bee, that
was humming loudly in the foliage above his
head and looking like a shining ball of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
among the green leaves. He had received a
letter from his mother that morning, and he
was a bit homesick.</p>

<p>"El Se√±orito is <i>triste</i>. No?" It was Jos√©'s
voice behind him.</p>

<p>Francisco brushed away a tear that had
stolen down his cheek, and turned to greet the
Indian with a smile. "I was wishing to see
Elena, but it won't be long now; and I shall
hate to leave this lovely place, too. But one
can't have everything one wants, all at the
same time, can one, Jos√©?"</p>

<p>"No, Se√±orito, but we always have <i>one</i> happiness;
have you noticed it? There never
comes a time when we haven't one, at least.
Now I've one just now, and I am going to share
it with you. It will take away your sadness."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it another fishing trip?"</p>

<p>"No, but it's better. Now listen, and I will
tell you about it.</p>

<p>"While the <i>gauchos</i> were dancing and making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
merry over your birthday, last night, some
miserable robbers got into the horse corrals
and stole all the horses' tails."</p>

<p>"The horses' tails!" gasped Francisco.</p>

<p>"Yes, you see that's partly what we raise
wild horses for; their skins and their tails.
South American horsehair for mattresses is
famous all over the world, and it brings good
prices. Now, these thieves make their living
by visiting the different <i>estancias</i> and helping
themselves to the horses' tails.</p>

<p>"Word came to your uncle, just before he
left, that when one hundred of his horses were
driven out of the Corral De Oeste this morning,
they hadn't a single tail among them. So he
has offered one hundred <i>pesos</i> to the one, or ones,
who can catch these thieves. Would you like
to try?"</p>

<p>Had Jos√© asked him if he would like to swing
on to the new moon by his toes Francisco could
not have been more startled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try&mdash;! Why Jos√©, you can't be in earnest!"</p>

<p>"<i>Como no?</i>" grinned the Indian cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But Jos√©, wouldn't they shoot us, and,
anyhow, I know you are jesting when you ask
<i>if I</i> would care to try. You,&mdash;you are a strong
man, even if you are getting old, and I heard
the <i>peon</i> children down by the huts say that
there was no man for leagues and leagues
around that could wrestle as you do; that you
learned how from a Japanese soldier years
ago in Chile. And I know you can shoot; but
I would just be in the way."</p>

<p>"No, Se√±orito, you wouldn't be in the way.
Manuel and I want you to go with us because
we need you."</p>

<p>"Need <i>me!</i> Oh, Jos√©!" and Francisco's eyes
gleamed brightly. "Do you think Uncle
would allow me to go with you?"</p>

<p>"He is not here to say, and we must leave
before he returns. But he left you in my care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and if I feel sure no harm can befall you, I see
no reason why you should not go."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" shouted the happy boy,
dancing around Jos√© and clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"This is the greatest adventure I ever had.
To hunt brigands! Why, it's too good to be
true. Won't Ricardo grow green with envy
when I tell him about it, and won't the little
English boy sit with his eyes wide open, while
I recount the story to him. He will hush up
about his ostriches and guanacos after this,"
and Francisco sat on the ground hugging his
knees, and rocking to and fro gleefully.</p>

<p>"Well, don't clean your turtles till you've
tied them, Se√±orito. We may not get them.
It's only because I have a clue and a scheme
that I am willing to try; for they are pretty
clever fellows and they won't be easy to catch.
We want to take you for a decoy, and besides,
I think you would enjoy it. A Lacevera, even
at nine years of age, is no coward."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"A coward, I should say not. Why, Jos√©,
I am <i>never</i> afraid. But what is a decoy?"</p>

<p>"A decoy? Well, that's what we used when
we caught flamingoes the other night. Do
you remember how we put young frogs on the
end of a string and then lay low in the grass
and waited?"</p>

<p>"But, you can't tie a string to me, Jos√©&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;besides
I don't be&mdash;believe I
want to be a decoy. It isn't that I'm not
brave; no, indeed, Jos√©&mdash;but I think I would
rather you would decoy them with something
else."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, Se√±orito, and I promise
they won't hurt you. You must have forgotten
you are a Lacevera. They shall not gobble
you up as the flamingoes did the frogs. Just
what would you buy, anyhow, if you got your
share of the reward?"</p>

<p>"Buy!&mdash;Let me see. There are so many
things to buy. But now that I have my lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
saddle and silver stirrups I don't need much
for myself. I think I would buy a beautiful
parasol, all lace and chiffon, for Guillerma, for
young ladies don't care for anything much but
clothes. Then I should buy a jewelled fan
for Mam√°, and then&mdash;well, I believe Elena
and I would spend the balance for Carnival
as it comes next month. But Jos√©, what did
you say about not cleaning your turtles till
you had tied them?"</p>

<p>Jos√© laughed and patted him on the back.
"True, Don Francisco. But let me tell you
our plan, or part of it. I have reason to believe
that these two horsetail thieves are taking
shelter with some charcoal burners over near
the river. These charcoal burners are rough
men, who live almost like savages. They injure
no one, however, and it is only when they
quarrel among themselves that they do any
harm. They may not know who these men
are, and are allowing them to tarry with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
believing them to be beggars, or <i>gauchos</i> hunting
employment.</p>

<p>"I feel sure they are too loyal to the <i>estancia</i>
to harbour them if they knew who they
were. Now be ready immediately after breakfast,
for we must start in time to reach the
charcoal kilns before dusk."</p>

<p>It was twelve o'clock, when Jos√©, Manuel
and Francisco galloped off in the direction
of the river, and it was just <i>mate</i> time when they
came in sight of the charcoal kilns and adobe
huts near the river's bank.</p>

<p>Gathered about the fires, over which hung
boiling water for making the <i>m√°te</i>, were several
clusters of these uncouth appearing men. Dirty
looking women sat in groups apart, with dozens
of dirtier children rolling about on the hard earth
at their feet. A pack of dogs ran out to greet
them, yelping in front of their horses, until
they were called off by their respective owners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Jos√© and Manuel approached one group,
and after greeting and being greeted, asked
for boiling water with which to make <i>mate</i>.
This was given willingly, and with Francisco
they sat down on the ground among the men
and began leisurely to sip <i>mate</i> from the gourd
that Manuel always carried in his saddle bags.</p>

<p>They talked in friendly fashion with the
dirty <i>carboneros</i>, who were as black as the fuel
they made. Francisco noticed two men, who
were less grimy in appearance and who sat
quietly side by side, taking no part in the conversation.</p>

<p>They glanced occasionally at Jos√© and Manuel
in a hostile manner, and suspicion seemed
to lurk in their attitude towards them. Francisco
felt sure these were the thieves, but Jos√©
and Manuel took no notice whatever of them
and Francisco feared his friends had not seen
them.</p>

<p>After <i>mate</i> Francisco asked to see the kilns
and Jos√© and Manuel took him over to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
them and explain to him how the willow was
made into charcoal. It was quite dark when
they returned to the huts and proposed that
they return to the <i>casa</i>.</p>

<p>"Can the boy take another long ride in the
same day?" asked one of the <i>carboneros</i>, more
kindly in manner than the rest. "Is he not
exhausted? We have no shelter here, but you
are welcome to roll up in your blankets by
the fires, for the night wind from the Pampas
is cool."</p>

<p>"No, it is moonlight. A thousand 'gracias'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
for your offer, but the lad is a good rider and
we shall be home before midnight;" and bidding
them <i>adios</i>, Jos√© and Manuel with Francisco,
wondering at their behaviour, started
towards the enclosure where the horses had
been staked together with several other animals.</p>

<p>And then Jos√© did a thing that made Francisco's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
eyes fairly start from his head. He
deliberately lifted up the stake to which a
piebald mare, belonging to one of the thieves,
was tethered, and throwing the knotted end
of the long bridle across the pommel of his
own saddle, rode out at the far end of the enclosure.</p>

<p>As he galloped off, Manuel and Francisco
followed and soon they were all abreast, their
horses' swift feet brushing the evening dew
from the pampas grass as they flew along the
level prairie. They rode so fast that the little
fellow could not venture a question, it required
all of his wits to keep his seat.</p>

<p>They had gone thus for fifteen or twenty
minutes when he heard the sound of horses'
hoofs away off in the distance.</p>

<p>"Carramba! They are after us," cried
Manuel. "Good! Now for the chase. Let
your heart be glad, Se√±orito, they have taken
the bait."</p>

<p>Still Francisco wondered, he could not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
see through their plans, but excitement made
his blood run hot through his veins; and he
held on to Barboza's neck and spurred her on
to keep the pace.</p>

<p>When a glimpse of water ahead of them,
sparkling in the moonlight, told them they
were near the river Salinas, a small tributary
to the great river they had just left, the men
slackened their speed and Francisco was able
to get a full breath.</p>

<p>He could hear the soft thud of the pursuing
horses' feet on the pampas grass plainer and
plainer, and when their own horses were within
a few hundred feet of the stream he could hear
the men's shouts.</p>

<p>"Are there more than two?" asked Jos√©.</p>

<p>"No, just the two thieves, themselves.
Those <i>carboneros</i> would never give us pursuit.
It is none of their affair and they seldom meddle.
They probably loaned one a horse in place
of this one you are leading."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or they helped themselves as we did,"
chuckled the Indian.</p>

<p>They were close to the ford now; in the
bright moonlight the middle of the river gleamed
and danced; but the two banks were in deep
shadow because of the heavy clumps of willows
and low growing trees.</p>

<p>The thieves were but a short distance behind
them when their horses plunged into the water.</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised! So far&mdash;so good,"
whispered Jos√© to Francisco. "Now do just
as I bid you; our time is come."</p>

<p>They crossed the ford and were leaving the
water, enveloped in the dense shadows, when
Jos√© dropped from his horse and threw the
reins into Francisco's hand; Manuel did the
same, as Jos√©'s voice said in a whisper,</p>

<p>"Ride half a league and wait for us."</p>

<p>And now the boy saw their plan; he was to
ride ahead, the hoof beats of the four horses
indicating to the pursuers that they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
still fleeing, and Jos√© and Manuel in ambush
would have it all their own way.</p>

<p>He spurred his horse to its highest speed;
but it seemed to him that his heart-beats would
drown the hoof beats, so vigorously was it
pounding against his side. It was an anxious
interval and to the fleeing boy seemed an eternity;
but it was really but half a minute when
he heard a sharp cry, and then&mdash;a shot. But
he rode on, fearing to stop until the half league
was covered. He knew the fight was over
and that either Jos√© and Manuel were being
carried back to the huts beside the big river,
or that they would soon overtake him with their
prisoners.</p>

<p>Soon a shout came to his ears. It was Jos√©'s
voice and his mind was relieved. He reined
in the horses, which was an easy matter for
they were panting, and waited beside a shrine,
whose white cross stood like a ghost beside
the trail; and soon he saw four figures toiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
along, two in front and two behind. The two
in the rear were Jos√© and Manuel, and they
were holding their pistols close to the heads
of the two in front, who walked with the shambling
gait of men whose feet were hobbled,
as they were, with stout <i>bola</i> thongs; their hands
were tied behind them, and as they shuffled
unevenly along they were bawling out curses,
the like of which Francisco's ears had never
heard.</p>

<p>But the boy was so eager to hear about their
capture that he paid no attention to the vile
language, that at any other time would have
made him cringe and tremble.</p>

<p>"Oh! Jos√©&mdash;Manuel&mdash;Do tell me all about
it! How did you get them?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, we grappled with them so
unexpectedly that they had no time to defend
themselves; thanks to the little frog on the end
of the string," and Jos√© patted the boy on the
shoulders encouragingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"One of them tried to shoot as he was regaining
his feet, just after we dragged them
from their horses, and Manuel has a scratch
on his thigh, but otherwise, we are all well and
doing finely. Manuel will ride on to the <i>casa</i>
for help and you and I will remain here to
keep these gentlemen company. They are great
on talking, just listen to them now. Maybe
they will tell us the price of horsehair per kilo&mdash;eh,
gentlemen?" and the Indian grinned
derisively at the cursing men.</p>

<p>"But Jos√©, Manuel is not fit for the saddle;
let me go to the house. Please, I beg of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! Alone&mdash;and at night. Why, the
Colonel <i>would</i> say I had risked much should he
see you ride in at midnight&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"Uncle? Why uncle Juan is always pleased
when I show any bravery; and besides there
is nothing else to do. Manuel can't stay with
just me here&mdash;he is suffering, and he can't
ride&mdash;so it's the only thing to be done."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, but you will have to ride pretty fast,
Se√±orito, and tell them to send the <i>peons</i> immediately.
Here, ride the piebald mare. It's yours
anyhow, I dare say, or will be. It has been all
day in the corral and is fresh, while Barboza
is tired."</p>

<p>Jos√© changed the saddle, and Francisco
was off towards the <i>casa</i>.</p>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock when Don Carlos
awoke the Colonel, who had returned about
midnight from his journey.</p>

<p>"Who calls, Colonel? It sounds like the
Ni√±o's voice."</p>

<p>They were out by the edge of the house
corral, as Francisco rode up, and with almost
the last breath he seemed to have left in his
little body, he shouted,</p>

<p>"We've caught them! We've caught them!
They are over by the 'Last Tribute' shrine
near the Rio Salinas, and Jos√© and Manuel
are waiting for help to bring them here; Jos√©<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
could not bring them alone, and Manuel has a
wound."</p>

<p>His uncle was lifting the tired Ni√±o from the
saddle, but he did not place him on the ground;
he carried him close to his heart into the house
and laid him on his soft bed. He left him saying
he would go with Don Carlos to help rouse
the <i>peons</i>, and Francisco heard him blow his
nose vigorously as he crossed the <i>patio</i>, and
knowing that his Uncle Juan had no cold, he
accepted the tribute to his bravery with a proud
smile, and was asleep before he knew it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CARNIVAL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Francisco</span> had been at home now for a week.
He had returned to find Elena rosy and well
and the house in a turmoil of preparation, for
Guillerma was to be married. Her fianc√©
was a wealthy <i>estanciero</i> from the province of
Mendoza, which lies almost at the foot of the
Andes, and he had made a fortune from raising
grapes for wine. His <i>estancia</i>, also, produced
great quantities of figs, dates and sugar cane.</p>

<p>Guillerma was very happy, for although El
Se√±or Conquero was older than she by fifteen
years, theirs was a genuine love match. He
had seen her at mass, one morning, and the
following day, he had presented himself to
her mother and her Uncle Juan with irreproachable
credentials, and their engagement of six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
months was to culminate in the celebration of
their marriage during the early part of March.</p>

<p>It would be a very quiet wedding, for Se√±or
Conquero was in mourning for his father, who
had died over a year before; and the custom
of mourning in Argentina demands two years
of seclusion from all social events after the
loss of a parent.</p>

<p>Her Uncle Juan had been most generous in
his allowance for her trousseau, and she, with
her mother, was busy all of each day visiting
the dressmakers and shops.</p>

<p>Francisco, at first, was very much distressed
because Guillerma was to live in Mendoza,
as that fertile province is the seat of numerous
earthquake disturbances. Scarcely a month
passes that the inhabitants are not startled
by one, and as a rule they sleep with open doors
to insure a quick exit in case one occurs during
the night.</p>

<p>But Guillerma assured him she did not fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them, as there had been no serious ones since
1861, and when she began telling him of the
beautiful home she would have, surrounded
by wide vineyards and orchards of olives and
figs, where he could come to visit her, and with
Elena play just as they pleased, he became
better reconciled to her marriage.</p>

<p>He was very busy, himself, for Carnival, the
great festival, came early this year, and never
before had he had so much money to spend in
its celebration.</p>

<p>He and Jos√© and Manuel had divided the
reward money they had received for capturing
the horsetail thieves, and Francisco felt very
proud of his share of it. He and Elena had
counted it over and over, and planned how
each <i>peso</i> should be spent. Each one of the
family, including the servant, should have a
gift, and the balance would be their own
to use as they chose for the celebration of the
greatest <i>fiesta</i> of the whole year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>As in many Roman Catholic countries, Carnival
comes during the week preceding Lent;
and although it is really a church festival, it is
the least religious of any celebration, whether
of church or state.</p>

<p>In Buenos Aires everything dates from it
and everything stops for it; even business is
suspended. It is a festival of merriment and
revelry, and every house and every street is
decorated before its arrival in flags, banners,
streamers and lanterns. There are processions
and continuous parades, with crowds of people
in masks and dominoes, blowing horns, dancing
and singing.</p>

<p>This year, Francisco and Elena were to be
allowed to enter the <i>corso</i> or Carnival parade,
and Uncle Juan had offered his motor car,
which was to be decorated with garlands of
paper flowers; Jos√© was to be their chaperon
and Enrique would drive the car.</p>

<p>Elena and Francisco owned their little costumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which they had used on previous occasions,
but as they had their own money this
year, they had decided to buy new ones to
wear in the parade.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i171.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="children in car waiting" />
<span class="caption">&quot;ELENA AND FRANCISCO WERE DRESSED AND READY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Elena was to be dressed as a shepherdess,
and Francisco as a Spanish king. Their mother
had neglected Guillerma and her trousseau one
entire day, in order to go with the children
to help them select their costumes and masks;
for no one enters into the streets in costume
without a mask or domino.</p>

<p>The morning of the day on which the great
parade was to take place the children spent,
dressed in their old costumes, playing with the
neighbours' children in the streets.</p>

<p>Although the law had forbidden the custom of
throwing water at pedestrians, the number of
people who were drenched by unexpected pails
of water thrown from upper balconies was not
lessened, and the children broke dozens of
<i>pomos</i>, or rubber balls filled with perfumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
water, on each other and strangers, as well,
who chanced to pass.</p>

<p>After <i>siesta</i> that afternoon, Elena and Francisco
began their preparations for the parade;
and when the gayly decorated car drove up
about six o'clock with a fiery red representation
of His Majesty, the devil, on the front seat
and a <i>pierrot</i> or harlequin with one half of
his costume a vivid green and the other half
yellow, Elena and Francisco were dressed and
ready.</p>

<p>The harlequin jumped out and bowed low to
the ground, and Elena ran back into the house,
for she was sure this comical looking fellow
could never be Jos√©. But she was reassured
when he lifted his mask, and soon the huge car
was puffing along the street with the red driver
in front and a dainty little shepherdess, a small
king in velvet, gold lace and a crown, and a
harlequin in green and yellow, all sitting on
the back seat, throwing confetti and waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
banners and shouting at the people gathered
on the corners or on the balconies of the houses.</p>

<p>Enrique took them up one street and down
another, among the crowds of the other carriages
and automobiles, all full of gayly dressed
maskers bent on making as much noise as
possible.</p>

<p>As it grew darker the streets began to blaze
with arches of electric lights, many of the bulbs
being swung inside Chinese lanterns. The
crowd grew denser and many times they were
caught in a mass of carriages, that could move
neither one way nor the other. Mounted police
were everywhere, trying to disperse the people
where the crowds were too thick, and even
they were treated to the contents of hundreds
of <i>pomos</i> until their horsetail plumes and
scarlet lined capes dripped perfume like water.</p>

<p>At eight Enrique stopped the car in a side
street opening on to the great Plaza, where the
procession was to form; his plan being to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the children a view of part of the parade from
this vantage point, and then to slip out the side
street and enter the <i>corso</i> from the rear.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock when the bands of music
took their places at the head of the procession
and they were followed by large fancifully
decorated wagons, filled with young ladies
dressed to represent well known allegories.</p>

<p>Then came floats with papier-mache
figures caricaturing political events in the
history of the Republic. These were followed
by companies of horsemen dressed in every sort
of fantastic costume; victorias filled with merry
maskers, floats with goddesses, and burlesqued
well-known public characters. King Carnival
was seated on a high throne, very handsomely
draped, and drawn by sixteen pure white
horses. When the children grew tired of looking,
Enrique joined the procession itself, and the
hearts of Elena and Francisco were beating
high with excitement, for their ambition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
realized&mdash;to be a <i>part</i> of the great Carnival
<i>corso</i>.</p>

<p>It was quite one o'clock before Jos√© could
persuade them to leave it and be taken home;
and it was many days before they ceased to
talk of their wonderful experience.</p>

<p>But school would open immediately after
Carnival and Francisco was anxious to reenter,
as he was fond of books and made good progress
in his studies.</p>

<p>His Aunt Sarita with her six daughters had
returned from their summer outing and Uncle
Juan was preparing for a trip abroad immediately
after Guillerma's wedding should take
place. Francisco saw him often, for they had
grown very fond of each other during their
summer together, and even Aunt Sarita began
to love him more as she saw him oftener.</p>

<p>The first day of school had arrived, and Francisco,
in his clean linen duster, had proudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
led Elena to the school, for this was to be her
first year. He was very proud of his pretty
sister, who was shy, and held on tightly to
her protector's sunburned hand.</p>

<p>He introduced her to her teacher, kissed her,
and then hurried out into the large <i>patio</i> to
greet his old school friends.</p>

<p>They were all there, like a flock of tan coloured
butterflies in their linen coats, their hair brushed
sleekly into place and their faces and hands
smelling of recent cleansing with perfumed
soaps.</p>

<p>Francisco was a favourite. Soon he was in
the middle of a group of interested listeners,
recounting to them his experiences on the
<i>estancia</i>.</p>

<p>He was only human, and you must forgive
him if he told of his adventure with the horsetail
thieves. Even the little English boy grew
excited and plied him with questions that seriously
retarded Francisco in his account of
their capture. The bell rang just as he finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and they all fell into line in the <i>patio</i>, where the
beautiful Argentine national hymn was sung,
and the Argentine flag of blue and white was
saluted by each pupil as they passed it on their
way into the school-rooms.</p>
